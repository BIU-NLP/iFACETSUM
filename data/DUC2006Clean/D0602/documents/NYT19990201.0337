LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs. 

 The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors, follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 

 The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of drugs. 

 The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities. And there is some doubt whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings. 

 ``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise.'' 

 ``All of this is interwined. The drug scandals are not separate from the bribes. This is the modus operandi of this organization. 

 ``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business. So you cover it up. You put in place a system that would hoodwink the public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but you can say you have a system. The problem is, people have become wise to the PR scam.'' 

 As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and cheats. 

 Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later had to retract. Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful to athletes. He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed had harmful side effects. 

 Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50 million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the ground. This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an international doping agency and to commit $25 million to anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping offenders. 

 Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to research. 

 ``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert attention,'' Helmick said. 

 Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the independence of the agency. 

 On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of ``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some first-time offenders. The suspicion has lingered for years that the IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free Olympics. 

 Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the athletes tested positive at an Olympiad. 

 Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders. An arbitration panel threw out the disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for using a stimulant. 

 The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at $500,000 each. De Merode said the tests were declared invalid because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the IOC medical commission. 

 ``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne Ljungqvist said. ``Of course, it concerns me.'' 

 Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up ``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games. Those athletes' initial ``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive. 

 The athletes were never identified. 

 De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close of the Games. History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10 positive tests, not 19. 

 ``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976 Olympics),'' Catlin said. ``That never came to pass. Then, it came out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost. I don't know where they went. All I know is there were some cases that did not go to 'B' confirmation.'' 

 Former U.S. Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the (U.S.) women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime in their preparation for the Games.'' 

 None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben Johnson flunking a test for steroids. In retrospect, he often is cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug use to get caught. 

 In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test. 

 Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the Russian ship near the close of the Games. He later confirmed the story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab. 

 ``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last minute,'' Catlin said. ``But that is not unlike the situation being revealed during the East German trials. They did the exact same thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things. . . . 

 ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before leaving for the Games. But there is a difference between the practice and what is done with the results. If you don't do anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that is wrong.'' 

 Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy. The U.S. Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather than contracting with an independent agency. Its own advisory panel concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the USOC supports the same athletes financially. 

 Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official acknowledged.
