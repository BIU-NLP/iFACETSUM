SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian 400-meter runner Svetlana Pospelova tested positive for banned drugs in an out-of- competition test, International Olympic Committee officials said Saturday. 

 Pospelova was found to have steroid stanozolol in her system, according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission. 

 Pospelova, who won the European Cup at Gateshead, England, on July 15, was not a medalist in Sydney. 

 The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday. However since she has left the country and is not expected to compete again, the matter is expected to be turned over to the international federation to consider the case and possible sanctions. 

 Pospelova would be the seventh athlete to test positive at the Games, which have been enveloped in doping cases since well before the start two weeks ago. 

 She had already returned to Russia when the medical commission received the drug test result, de Merode said. 

 Full details will be available after the IOC executive board meeting.
