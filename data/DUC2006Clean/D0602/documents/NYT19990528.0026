SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to promote the health benefits of drinking milk. 

 Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still be glorified. 

 The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture. 

 Let's start with McGwire. 

 The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health benefits of drinking milk. 

 Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple: 

 ``Going, going, gone. Time for milk. It's got stuff leading sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium. That's why I always have an ice cold glass ... as soon as I get home.'' 

 Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the steroid-producing substance androstenedione? 

 He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too. 

 Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally unabashed in admitting his andro use. He says it ensures better workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free seasons in the dramatic 1998. 

 Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and failing on this issue is significant. 

 In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, called for the federal government to study the health effects of androstenedione. 

 The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year, even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged using the substance for at least one year as part of his training regimen. 

 In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday, former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's leadership on this issue. And Moses was not afraid to point the finger at McGwire. 

 ``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid. Despite all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said. 

 A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children. 

 ``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _ have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said. 

 ``The alarming numbers are not the only story. Drug use in sport is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ... 

 ``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said. 

 Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs. 

 What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles. 

 That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial substance now under serious scrutiny. 

 On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took place this NBA playoff season. It happened when I looked into Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals. 

 Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98 season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made to shock. 

 ``People say I'm what's wrong with sports. I say I'm a three-time NBA All-Star. People say I'm America's worst nightmare. I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the camera close-up. 

 The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model. 

 Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial. It's just pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than to go ahead and send the wrong message.
