MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Spanish pole vaulter Dana Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) said on Wednesday. 

 The Spaniard tested positive at the European Championships in Budapest on August 16, an IAAF spokesman said, adding "but all the business is currently in the hands of the Spanish federation." 

 A source close to the Spanish federation said that there were a number of discrepancies surrounding Cervantes' positive sample. 

 Cervantes took the test at her own request after she was not randomly selected in the qualifying rounds of the championship where she set a Spanish national record and eventually finished 11 th in the finals. 

 "They (the Spanish federation) asked us to respect the athlete' s confidentiality in this case, which would have been broken if we published her name, although we have been assured by the Spanish federation that she will not compete until the case is clarified," the IAAF spokesman added. 

 If Cervantes' positive test is confirmed, she could be banned from the sport for two years.
