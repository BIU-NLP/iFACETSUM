NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a questionnaire. Their objective: to determine tennis trends and, in particular, whether spectators attending the U.S. Open would pay to watch a tournament with only female players. 

 The remarkably positive response of that informal survey by Ceci Martinez and Esme Emanuel was a declaration of independence for women's sports. And if Title IX became the bill of rights for female athletes, this summer has emerged as the exclamation point for any equal-rights amendment. 

 From Women's World Cup soccer to U.S. Open tennis, from the world track and field championships to the Pan-Pacific swimming meet, the message has been unmistakably clear: Women can hold their own on any stage, with or without men. 

 Teresa Weatherspoon's game-winning shot in the Women's National Basketball Association finals last week was as mind-boggling and riveting as was Jerry West's dramatic heave decades earlier. And the Houston Comets' three-peat earned them a legacy alongside other basketball dynasties. 

 But the women have also stolen the show. Even minus Steffi Graf's majestic presence and Anna Kournikova's photogenic tease, Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and others have created enough competitive subplots to justify an equal-pay mantra. Davenport's bold backhand winner against Mary Pierce from match point down in their compelling quarterfinal three-setter was the gutsy shot of the tournament. 

 The notion that the women must play best-of-five sets to earn singles parity at Grand Slam events (not so at the U.S. Open, which is the only equal-opportunity employer) is as outmoded as trying to equate the price of a Broadway show ticket to the length of a performance. Substance always prevails over style (as Andre Agassi has learned), even if you need personalities for box-office bait. 

 Thirty years ago, only Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and a handful of others understood what really mattered. Now the Williams sisters have rewritten the rules of the road for junior tennis, and Jong Song Ok's victory for North Korea in the women's marathon at the world track championships may have opened yet another door into a closed society just as Tegla Loroupe brought African women out of obscurity with her New York City Marathon victories. Even Brandi Chastain's celebrated stripdown at the Women's World Cup final will be analyzed by the Associated Press Sports Editors in a newsletter. 

 Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of female athletes. ``We players were unhappy with the status quo,'' she said the other day by phone from her home in San Mateo, Calif., where she works in real estate. ``And like all reformers, we were considered radical in our time, chided for our feminist views simply because we wanted equal opportunity in all its ramifications.'' 

 The positive results of that study, coupled with an early sponsorship commitment from Philip Morris, gave women's tennis its first financial cushion. Now sponsors are using today's pros and even a former great, Althea Gibson, to sell themselves and this year's Open. 

 But the bright lights have also brought murkier, less romantic overtones to women's sports. At the world track championships in Spain, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a 39-year-old sprinter who had won 14 medals during a venerable career, was forced to withdraw from the meet after traces of the banned steroid nandrolone were found in one of her urine samples. 

 And lost amid the flurry of world swim records set by South African Penny Heyns at the Pan-Pacifics in Sydney's Olympic pool was her disclosure that creatine was an integral part of her training regimen. Although legal as a nutritional supplement, creatine has been associated with bulking up male bodies for football, baseball and the beach more than female swimmers. 

 ``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,'' said Heyns, who set an astonishing seven world records in her last 10 races. ``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on the blocks during my career and know that I`ve trained and swum as hard as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't do the best I could in. I want to cover all the bases.'' 

 These words are a far cry from the days when pasta, carbo-loading and electrolyte solutions were considered new-age nutritional training tools. But Heyns' times will almost certainly resonate around the world on the road to Sydney next September just as many coaches have finally moved beyond East Germany's systematic steroid scandal of the '70s. Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women. 

 ``Title IX has certainly helped,'' Martinez said, of what awaits women, ``but looking beyond the sports arena, women are still struggling to break through the glass ceiling in all facets of life, especially in business, politics and the mass media.''
