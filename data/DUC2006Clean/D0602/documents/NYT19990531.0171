Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder, teen-age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers, health authorities say. 

 The increased usage among girls, which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s. And steroid use, researchers say, exposes girls to the same severe health risks, but with the added potential of destroying their ability to bear children. 

 The National Institutes of Drug Abuse says about 175,000 teen-age girls in the United States have reported taking anabolic steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise of 100 percent since 1991. The surveys, by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System, were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported questionnaires. 

 Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston, director of the Michigan project, which has been conducting annual youth surveys since 1975, said the actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent surveys show, since people tend to underreport drug use. The rate among teen-age boys has also continued to rise, to the current estimated level of 325,000. 

 Other indications, including the results of a small study in Oregon, are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated. The three national surveys were conducted before Mark McGwire set baseball's single-season home run record last year, acknowledging that he used androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone, to help him build muscle. Whether androstenedione, which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other sports, does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical dispute, though the perception of many athletes, both adult and adolescent, is that it does. In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids. 

 ``I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as well as boys,'' said Dr. Linn Goldberg, a physician at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and a United States Olympic Committee drug testing official. ``Some are concerned and some want to know whether their children should use androstenedione.'' 

 His answer is an unequivocal no, either to use of steroids or androstenedione. 

 Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice. The hormone exists in females as well, though in much smaller amounts. Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages. 

 The health damages might not appear for years or decades after the steroids are taken, said Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine. 

 Dr. Charles E. Yesalis, a steroid authority at Pennsylvania State University, was among the first to analyze the 1997 female-adolescent data in December of that year in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm. 

 Most prevention programs, he said recently, have not been effective. ``I am asked to speak in schools and other institutions,'' Yesalis said, ``but you don't get anywhere with speeches or charts or film clips or posters. We know one-shot messages don't work.'' 

 Goldberg said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms. ``That's where most people say they obtain them,'' Goldberg said. ``Someone, in this part of the country, will go down to Mexico, where it is easy to get the stuff, and bring it back, either in pill form or injectables.'' And then one young person will buy some and distribute them to his or her schoolmates, he said. 

 The new interest among teen-age girls, these and other health experts say, reflect a gradual change in attitude, and fashion, or teen-age peer pressure, away from a preoccupation with thinness. Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat more muscular, but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles. 

 ``We've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women, to the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in between, the lean but muscular type,'' Wadler said. ``These are people who are virtually addicted to the mirror. But they will never be satisfied with what they see, and this is now happening to teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger their muscles have become.'' 

 Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr., chief of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory of Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital, and colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as ``reverse anorexia'' after it was observed in 1993. The researchers recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders, 17 of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body dysmorphism, which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or not. 

 Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships. But Pope said too little research had been done on this emerging obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about its complex causes.
