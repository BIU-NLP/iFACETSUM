BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers. All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills. Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had thought they were were reversible. ``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his co-defendants. Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989. One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13. Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair growth. Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic champions. Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests. But since German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German government files. On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part of his responsibility. He denied ever giving steroid injections, as prosecutors have charged. Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers. Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic endurance. However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids. Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for ill effects from the steroids. Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and nothing worrying was found. Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with acute liver problems. He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents. Because all five made statements before the court, no other witnesses were likely to be called. A verdict could come as early as Thursday. Although they could get up to three years in prison, the defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines. The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin swim team. Only one, Dr. Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession. He admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that no one showed ill effects. His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be handed down. The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no verdict was expected.
