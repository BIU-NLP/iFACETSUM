ATLANTA _ It's no longer a secret. Many male athletes are supplementing their fitness techniques of chugging milk and lifting weights with performance-enhancing drugs. The temptation also is becoming too great for some female athletes to resist. Substances such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger boost. 

 _ According to the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.4 percent of female high-school students acknowledged using the illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males. 

 _ A survey of youngsters at four Massachusetts middle schools, published this spring in the journal Pediatrics, found that 2.6 percent of girls were users, barely behind the 2.8 percent rate for boys. 

 _ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10 percent in track and field. 

 ``When there is increased competition and more at stake,'' Yesalis said, ``potential pro outlets and potential scholarships because of Title IX, you're going to see more people willing to cheat to gain an advantage over their opponent. 

 ``You're seeing an increased number of parents, similar with teenage boys, that get carried away. They don't provide their kids with a moral and ethical foundation, where they know there are certain boundaries you shall not cross in pursuit of victory.'' 

 There is no mistaking the dangers of steroids for women, with documentation provided by recent trials involving trainers and coaches from the former East German sports empire. 

 Heidi Krieger, 1986 European shot put champion, was given mysterious blue pills that she thought were vitamins. She developed facial hair and a dramatically enlarged Adam's apple. 

 Krieger recently announced plans to sue the coaches and trainers for allegedly force-feeding her steroids without her knowledge. Krieger had a sex-change operation and changed her first name to Andreas. 

 ``I trusted them, but they took advantage of me,'' Krieger testified at a trial of East German officials, some of whom admitted to supplying drugs to athletes. 

 Some sports leaders in the former Soviet Union and, more recently, China also have incorporated steroids into building strong women's programs. The carrot dangling in front of them is the relative newness of women's sports, which allows countries to make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics. ``We think it is easier for the women to shoot into international fame,'' said professor Tian Maijiu, vice president of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. 

 Chinese officials adamantly deny existence of a state-run doping program, claiming instead that individual coaches push too hard. The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have tested positive for steroids since 1990. When the Chinese women's swim team arrived in Australia for the world championships in January, customs officials uncovered 13 vials labeled ``growth hormone'' in an athlete's luggage. Four of those swimmers were banned this summer for two years. 

 A case study on the striking influence of steroids on women is the East German runner Marita Koch, whose 47.60 seconds for the 400 meters in 1985 is a world mark that still stands. 

 It turns out that Koch had been doping with Oral-Turinabol, a testosterone-based steroid, for at least four years leading up to her record run. 

 ``Women have relatively little (testosterone) and now, with testosterone-based anabolic steroids, you can double, triple, even increase by 10 times the amount (in their bodies),'' said Jaci Van Heest, director of exercise physiology for U.S. Swimming. ``The bang for the buck is much greater than doing it to a guy because they already have the natural amount. 

 ``Then, you have the huge growth in women's sports, and there are a lot of issues that make it fertile ground for any kind of cheating.''
