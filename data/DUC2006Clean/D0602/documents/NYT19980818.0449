When Samantha Reeves, a well-regarded amateur finding her way through her freshman season on the women's professional tennis circuit, wanted to hustle herself back into shape after sustaining an ankle injury late in 1997, she said she decided to experiment with a newfangled ``all-natural'' dietary supplement, apparently on the recommendation of a friend. 

 The product promised to help her burn fat and build muscle, and it was readily available over the counter at health-food stores. It sounded like the answer to her prayers: a training and diet aid that would help her get fit fast and get back to the business of cracking the top 100 in women's tennis. 

 Instead, Reeves' decision to use the product backfired badly. Required to submit a urine sample at an event last December as part of tennis' effort to detect improper drug use, Reeves failed the test. The dietary product, it turned out, had contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport. And so Reeves, despite her argument that she had no intention of taking anything aimed at improperly aiding her performance, became the first female tennis player ever to have tested positive for steroids. 

 ``I have never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis career,'' Reeves said in a statement that her family released after her test result was made public this summer. 

 The International Tennis Federation, which governs the sport, ultimately did not suspend or otherwise discipline Reeves, who was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Girls 18's in 1996, is currently ranked 106th in the world, and is undecided about whether to accept a college scholarship or turn pro. 

 Citing her age _ she turned 19 earlier this year _ and inexperience, and apparently accepting her claim that she was unaware of the presence of steroids in the product, the ITF instead called the long and embarrassing ordeal of testing, investigation and public disclosure ``a sanction in itself.'' 

 ITF spokesman Alun James said the investigation ``proved Reeves guilty of taking the banned substance and, although the decision against any further punishment is arguably lenient, if caught again, she could face a life ban as a second offender.'' 

 Reeves' case highlights a little discussed but troubling question for tennis: With the easy availability of illicit steroids, and the simultaneous explosion of fitness and muscle-building products that are sold legally but often with little warning about what they contain, how many players are trying to gain an inappropriate edge? Only one other player, Ignacio Truyol of Spain, has ever been formally detected of having used steroids. 

 Can tennis fairly and effectively police such use and the cheating _ either brazen or accidental _ that results? 

 ``Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these days, and they're not all coming from the black market,'' said Dr. Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA tours and for the ITF. 

 Jones said numerous high-tech or nouveau steroids are being marketed as simple food supplements and training aids and sold everywhere from the Internet to health-food stores. 

 ``It's conceivable that a player could be oblivious to the fact that they're using something that contains an anabolic substance,'' Jones said. ``They think: It's natural, it's pure, it's good for me. And that is an absolute fallacy.'' 

 Considering the plethora of legal products, such as creatine, available to athletes looking to boost their endurance, maximize their workouts and stave off flab, athletes subject to drug testing evidently cannot be too careful about what they ingest. Whether in the guise of vitamins, hormone supplements or food additives, there is apparently a synthetically engineered anabolic look-alike out there for everyone, whether the athletes are looking to raise a barbell or their tennis ranking. 

 While less invasive than the EPO-type injectables that recently tarnished cycling's Tour de France, or the substances currently muddying the reputation of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin, anabolics such as norandrolone, which is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, are far from benign. And once these legal additives break down in the system, a steroid by any other name tends to turn into a steroid. 

 The Nor-Andro 19 in the supplement Reeves chose is a product that, according to Jones, ``is the new kid on the block, the popular one right now. It's not a testosterone type of steroid, and the labs originally weren't testing for it. It's offered as a food supplement and marketed as a performance and training enhancer that increases muscle strength, mass and endurance.'' 

 Jones did say he was unaware of the product's ever having been marketed as a weight-loss product. 

 Tennis has stepped up its testing and the detection efforts of its anti-doping program, which is modeled on the one used by the International Olympic Committee. The ITF, in conjunction with the WTA and ATP tours, conducts roughly 1,000 tests each year, all of them random and 10 percent of them in locations other than the site of tournaments. 

 The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately $500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty of using steroids is the 23-year-old Truyol, who said he took them on the advice of his physician when recovering from an injury. 

 ``No sport is immune anymore,'' said Dr. Donna Smith of Substance Abuse Management, the company that administers tennis' anti-doping program. ``Wherever you have issues of injury recovery and athletes intent on maximizing their training, you're going to see this stuff. 

 ``Our window of detection is small, because most of these products clear the system within five days, and although we'd like to do more off-site testing, it's prohibitively expensive. You always feel like you're one step behind.''

 According to the Reeves family, Samantha's use of the steroid was purely accidental. The only people more surprised than the player herself were her parents, Jack and Jill Reeves. Their teen-age daughter was fixated on losing weight, Jack Reeves said, and, unbeknownst to him and his wife, bought the supplement. 

 When the family was notified, by fax, of the positive test and was asked to provide a record of every medication Samantha had ingested, steroids were not initially revealed as the culprit behind the positive reading, Jack Reeves said. Then came a phone call that informed them of the source of the positive result: The illegal nandrolone metabolites in her system were traced to Nor-Andro 19. Just after the conclusion of Wimbledon last month, the ITF announced that Reeves had tested positive for anabolic steroids. 

 ``We thought it was good news that they'd figured out how the stuff got into her system; we thought that was the end of it,'' said Jack Reeves, who would not permit his daughter to be interviewed. ``Then we were told the review board had decided to pursue the case and test a second sample. It's a kind of guilty-until-proven-innocent process where you're dealing with a lot of nameless, faceless parties. They do hold a player responsible for whatever is in their system, and they're not particularly interested in how it got there. You'd have to be a molecular biologist to know this would occur. 

 ``It's been a very troublesome, frustrating experience; tennis is such a mental game, and this has put a lot of extra pressure on her,'' he said. ``These days, Samantha won't drink a glass of water without having it analyzed.''
