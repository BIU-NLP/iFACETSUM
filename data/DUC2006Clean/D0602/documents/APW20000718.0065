BERLIN (AP) -- East Germany's former sports chief and his medical director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret doping program in the former communist country that turned promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions. 

 Manfred Ewald, 74, and Manfred Hoeppner, 65, were each convicted of 20 counts of being accessories to causing bodily harm for secretly administering steroids to the athletes. The men allegedly told the athletes they were giving them vitamins. 

 Ewald was sentenced to 22 months probation; Hoeppner was given 18 months. The court found them innocent of more serious charges that could have brought jail time. 

 Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and Hoeppner knew of the potential danger. 

 ''Those responsible have been called to account,'' said Michael Lehner, the attorney for the women. 

 Defense lawyers said they were considering an appeal. 

 A member of the communist party's central committee, Ewald was president of East Germany's sports federation from 1961-88 and of its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the country ceased to exist in 1990. 

 In its verdict, the court said Ewald was the ''driving force'' behind the doping program and kept it going with ''merciless hardness.'' 

 Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the details of the doping program -- including the secrecy rules -- and distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the court found. 

 Both shared responsibility for the ''systematic and overall doping in (East German) competitive sports,'' from 1974 until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the court found. 

 The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner because he had apologized to the athletes and cooperated with prosecutors in other doping cases. Ewald never made a direct apology. 

 Former track star Brigitte Michel, who was in court Tuesday, said she ''can live with'' the verdict even though the men most likely won't have to serve any time behind bars. They faced a maximum of two years. 

 ''There's no verdict anyway that can make up for the damage suffered,'' she said. 

 The athletes were seeking a conviction on a more serious charge. They say the drugs caused them to develop excessive body hair and deep voices and also caused gynecological problems. The baby of one former athlete was born with deformities allegedly linked to the drugs. 

 But the court said a direct connection could not be established between the steroids and each individual's specific illness. 

 The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany, with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972 to 40 in 1976. East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming in 1976 and again in 1980. 

 About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and others have been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.
