BERLIN (AP) _ Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive facial hair. The two professors said they examined 11 swimmers, all of whom were witnesses in the trial. Five of the women had changes in their voices, they said. One had heavy facial hair that was either caused or worsened by taking anabolic steroids, they said. Two women were diagnosed with liver damage, they said, and another had a liver tumor that could be traced back to taking a combination of contraceptive pills and steroids for eight years. Such side-effects of anabolic steroids have been generally known since 1977, they said. Horst Luebbert, a professor of clinical gynecology, cautioned, however that while the health damage was ``with all probability'' linked to doping, ``we can't offer (absolute) security.'' Luebbert and pharmacology professor Norbert Rietbrock testified in the trial against Dr. Dieter Binus. His case was severed from five other defendants _ four coaches and another doctor _ after he made a partial confession last month. The six were charged with causing bodily harm by administering performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers without informing the athletes or their parents. Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects. The next court date for his case was set for Aug. 24, when a verdict could be handed down. The five other defendants have not made any statements. Their trial resumes Monday. &UR; (pfg-xx)
