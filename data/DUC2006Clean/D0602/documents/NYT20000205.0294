Gottschalt recalled that in 1981, when she was 15, she left the swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman with a deep voice. Other problems ensued: liver ailments, a hardening of back muscles. In 1984 she gave birth to a son with a clubfoot. Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of her being given drugs. As years passed and her anger grew, she wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained. 

 ``I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me to take any interest,'' she said. ``I gave up thinking anything might happen.'' 

 Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related lawsuits. Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with the public prosecutor helped try it. Lehner represented Gottschalt in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said, also had children with birth defects. 

 Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers, young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive ``supporting means'' to improve their performance. ``Supporting means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid manufactured in East Germany. 

 Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had also been administered the little blue pills and who would be willing to testify. Court cases involving doping to that point had involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin. Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and Dresden who had been similarly doped. 

 Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to Gottschalt's. After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled depression. 

 Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol. Certain patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss because of illness. In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression. She made no additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her until Lehner called. 

 ``I suppressed what happened to me for so long,'' Krause said recently in Magdeburg. ``I am still searching for my biography.'' 

 In early January, Gottschalt, 34, Krause, 37, and three other former East German swimmers were present in a Berlin courtroom for the trial of Lothar Kipke. 

 During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a deepening of the voice. According to Kipke, as research increased in the 1980s, he began administering the steroids in lower dosages and only in pill form. 

 Ten feet from Kipke, Gottschalt listened to the doctor rationalize his actions. When she heard his lawyer explain that Kipke had only been following orders, Gottschalt exclaimed, ``Say that to my son's face!'' Daniel, her 14-year-old disabled son, sat beside her. 

 Krause seized the chance to address Kipke directly near the end of the trial. ``He avoided making a direct apology,'' Krause said. 

 Lehner called Kipke a ``monster.'' 

 ``What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like guinea pigs?'' Lehner said. 

 At the end of the one-day trial, Judge Peter Faust ruled that Kipke had acted with ``willful malevolence'' in overseeing doping of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor. Faust gave Kipke a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related punishment meted out to a former East German official. 

 The verdict provided little solace for Gottschalt, who had hoped that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed at the trial. 

 Faust declined Lehner's motion that the women whose children had birth defects receive financial compensation. 

 ``We are going to pursue this further,'' Lehner said. ``I am representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth defects.'' 

 A member of the Berlin program, Barbara Krause, who won a gold medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the 1980 Olympics, has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Lehner. She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however, because of her marriage to Lutz Wanja, a former swimming coach in Potsdam. Since the Kipke trial, Lehner has learned that a former swimmer in Leipzig has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot. 

 In the next trial, for which no date has been set, Lehner plans to refer again to evidence yielded by the Stasi files, which show that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could damage fetuses. 

 Kipke, 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be convicted on charges of doping. They were involved in swimming as well as other sports. 

 In May, several months before the statute of limitations runs out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals, Manfred Ewald and Manfred Hoeppner will have their day in court. Hoeppner, head doctor of the East German sports medicine service, oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the committee for all doping programs. Ewald, former president of the East German Athletics Association, wrote a book chronicling his control over East German sports. 

 Gottschalt said she would be in the courtroom once again. And to current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance, Gottschalt offers her own sobering advice. 

 ``Just leave it,'' she said. ``It's not worth it. Let your body perform on its own.''
