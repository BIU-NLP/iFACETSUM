MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays. 

 Su-24 assault planes and Su-24 bombers flew 10 sorties over the past 24 hours, targeting mountain trails in southern Chechnya to block rebel routes and rebel positions in mountain forests in the south and southeast regions. 

 Meanwhile, Mi-24 helicopter gunships took off 30 times to provide air support for ground troops. 

 Amid mounting incidence of rebel attacks, the federal command has restricted the movement of citizens across the republic during the May holidays to prevent subversive and terrorist acts, Interfax reported. 

 The movement of motor columns has been banned from May 1 to 11, the headquarters of the combined federal grouping said. 

 The situation in Chechnya remains complicated and federal checkpoints have come under attacks for five to eight times over the past 24 hours. 

 "The rebels operate in mobile groups consisting of five to 15 members, and carry out sorties to populated areas and to the flatland," Interfax quoted the headquarters as saying. 

 In another development, three policemen were killed Tuesday when their car came under fire on the Argun-Kizlyar motorway. The three were sent to Chechnya from Novorossiisk, Interfax said, quoting the Interior Ministry's Department for Chechnya.
