MOSCOW _ Russia's campaign against Islamic rebels in Chechnya moved closer to full-scale war Thursday as federal forces entered the breakaway Caucasus region where Moscow suffered a humiliating and costly defeat three years ago. 

 With Russian warplanes hammering targets in Chechnya for an eighth day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said an unspecified number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area had moved into positions inside Chechnya. 

 ``Combat operations in Chechnya are already under &UR;  &LR; way,'' Putin said in St. Petersburg. 

 Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives. 

 Putin did not say exactly where the soldiers crossed into Chechnya and there were no reports of ground fighting, but tensions were running high. 

 Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the border. 

 Chechnya's Defense Minister Magomed Khambiyev said specially trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news agencies here reported. 

 ``Combat action will start on the territory of Russia,'' Khambiyev said. ``Russian citizens (will) feel the gruesome nature of the war, the bitterness of losing relatives and friends.'' 

 Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya. The militants also have been blamed for four recent bomb blasts in Russia that killed nearly 300 people. 

 Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has been calling for talks to avert war but has been rebuffed by the Kremlin, which is demanding he turn over suspected terrorists. Thursday, Maskhadov appealed to Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to help set up talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin. 

 Russian generals have hinted that they plan to partition Chechnya and slowly push the rebel fighters into the mountains south of Grozny. Colonel General Valery Manilov, seen as one of the main planners of the operation, said the fighting could be concluded by winter. 

 Military analysts questioned the wisdom of beginning a ground campaign so late in the year _ especially one that appears to have been hastily improvised. 

 ``Military strategy says that you should never, ever, initiate a ground operation with winter approaching,'' said Alexander Zhilin, military analyst for the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. ``From a military point of view it makes no sense. I am afraid that there are going to be massive casualties.'' 

 Putin tried to play down the meaning of the Russian move into Chechnya, which Moscow sees as a part of Russia. Since federal troops withdrew from the region in 1996, Chechnya has run its own affairs, although no country has acknowledged its claim to independence. 

 Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks. 

 ``We have no border with Chechnya _ that is the Russian Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever necessary,'' Putin said. ``This is a very important question we must answer: Where do we want to create the security zone if we create one? On our own territory? And wait for them to come again to our villages . . . so that we would bomb our own people? I don't think that's very useful.'' 

 Putin, named by Yeltsin as the Kremlin's favored candidate in next year's presidential vote, has vowed to crush the rebels but avoid the mistakes of the last war. 

 Then, green Russian draftees were often thrown into battle situations where hardened Chechen guerrillas had nearly every advantage. Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately, turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies. 

 The current campaign already shows similarities. 

 The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel bases, but Chechnya's government accuses the Russians of indiscrimately hitting civilian targets. The Chechens say 550 civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians Thursday. 

 Terrified civilians continue to pour out of Chechnya, and a line of vehicles stretched for miles outside of Grozny Thursday. Already, 78,000 refugees have fled to Ingushetia, a tiny and impoverished Russian region west of Chechnya. 

 Some analysts said the Russian plan appears to be based on Putin's political goals, rather than military expediency. 

 ``This is mass idiocy,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst. ``I don't understand Russia's military strategy. I am afraid that Russia is headed for a total military disaster. I am really afraid.''
