MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops Tuesday continued air and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, destroying some rebel bases and a communications relay station, the Defense Ministry said. 

 Meanwhile, federal forces continued to prepare weapons and equipment for combat use and were taking measures to improve coordination between units, the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry's press service as saying. 

 The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch "large-scale retribution actions" while staging subversive and terrorist acts in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and Krasnodar. 

 It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia. 

 The rebels, avoiding direct clashes with federal troops, have resorted to "guerrilla tactics." 

 Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said. 

 Interfax reported that on Tuesday Moscow's envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, and representatives of the Chechen community and of the 1996 Chechen parliament arrived in Mozdok to set up local governing bodies. 

 Russia launched the massive assault on the rebels following two waves of armed incursions into Daghestan led by Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last name. 

 The two have been accused of masterminding a series of terrorist explosions that killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. 

 In Grozny, capital city of the rebel province, a commander said Chechnya is ready to name the organizers of those terrorist acts and produce material and documented evidence to international organizations and the press, Interfax reported. 

 While urging Chechen authorities to hand over Basayev, Khattab and other suspected terrorists, Moscow has all along rejected any mediation from outside, saying the Chechen issue is its internal affair.
