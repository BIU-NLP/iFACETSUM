MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to end its anti- terrorist operations in the breakaway republic of Chechnya by the end of February next year, said a top Russian military official Wednesday. 

 It will "take another two to three months" to eliminate the militants in Chechnya, said General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, at a meeting with foreign military attaches at the General Staff Academy. 

 He said about 12,000 to 15,000 militants have remained in Chechnya, including some 2000 terrorists and bandits backed by foreign extremists, adding that "this terrorist army will have to be eliminated unless the bandits surrender and lay down their arms. " 

 Manilov said the federal troops would liberate Grozny, capital of Chechnya, and he promised that "no massive attacks or storming of Grozny will be launched while even one civilian remains." 

 Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living. 

 "A total of 120 Chechen villages have been cleared of militant formations. Particularly the flat territory of Chechnya has been completely freed of bandits and terrorists," Manilov said. 

 The militants are fortifying their positions in sparsely populated mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, he said. 

 Earlier, the Russian troops freed the second biggest Chechen city of Gudermes and three other key Chechen towns of Argun, Urus- Martan and Shali, completing the surrounding of Grozny. 

 Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts.
