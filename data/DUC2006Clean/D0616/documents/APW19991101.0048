GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia opened several border crossings today with Chechnya, officials said, allowing terrified refugees to flee Russian air and rocket attacks after they had been blocked from leaving for days. 

 Officials opened border crossings at Stavropol, to the north of Chechnya, and at Dagestan, to the east of the breakaway republic, Russian news reports said. 

 At a third border crossing in the west, three bus loads of refugees, including children and some injured people, crossed from Chechnya into the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, which has already taken some 170,000 refugees. 

 But no other vehicles were let through, and a line of cars and trucks crammed with refugees stretched for several miles on the Chechen side. It was not clear why the Ingush border was not fully open. 

 ``We are ready to let the refugees pass, but it is necessary to keep order,'' Col. Arkady Krimsky said. He said the border would be opened to refugees for six days and border-crossers would undergo several document checks. 

 All borders were closed last week, trapping up to 20,000 refugees trying to flee Chechnya. 

 Only six miles away from the Ingushetia border crossing, Russian artillery today heavily shelled the Chechen town of Bamut. The town has been a prime target for weeks. 

 Russian jets and artillery also targeted the Chechen capital Grozny and several villages to the south today. Russia used Grad rocket launchers and howitzers to hit some targets, said Igor Melnikov, a spokesman with the Russian armed forces. 

 Russian jets bombed a spring overnight near the village of Chernorechiye, killing 10 civilians, said Ruslan Magomedov, an aide to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. 

 Magomedov said civilians had come to the spring for drinking water since supplies were cut shortly after the fighting began. 

 Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since Russia began its offensive in September. Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks. No independent confirmation is available, although medical workers have reported hundreds of civilian deaths. 

 Russian officials have said repeatedly that Chechen claims of civilian casualties are exaggerated. 

 Moscow has said it sent troops into Chechnya to crush the militants, who are also blamed for a series of deadly apartment explosions in September. 

 Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either. 

 ``We have no intention of conquering the republic and bringing its people to their knees,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency. Russia's goal is ``to destroy the terrorist stronghold in Chechnya and make (the republic's) revival possible.'' 

 ``We will never sit at a negotiating table with gangsters who have blood on their hands,'' Putin said. 

 Putin said Islamic militants, who twice invaded neighboring Dagestan from Chechnya this summer, were planning new attacks on chemical and nuclear power plants in Russia, as well as on Russia's transportation network. 

 Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions. 

 Makhashev said he wasn't making a threat ``but a belated warning,'' according to Interfax.
