MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday. 

 On Friday, seven guerrillas attacked an Interior Ministry forces post in the Chechen capital Grozny, using rifles and grenade launchers, Interfax quoted military sources as saying. There were no casualties among the Russians. 

 According to an unconfirmed report, a military post in the Argun district came under fire on Saturday, Interfax said. "The clash went on for quite a long time," a military source was quoted as saying. 

 Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes. 

 The governor of the Russian-controlled Nadterechnaya district said Russian security and police forces carried out a special operation on Saturday and detained 11 suspects. 

 The governor, Akhmed Zavgayev, told Interfax he could not confirm a report that a bomb had been found in Znamenskoye, a district center. 

 Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections. 

 A travel ban was imposed from Friday through Monday to ward off possible rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage. 

 The checking regime has been tightened; the protection of ballot stations strengthened and block stations at the entrances to villages reinforced, Interfax quoted military headquarters in the North Caucasus as saying on Friday. 

 Some 460,000 registered voters are expected to cast their ballots in 340 polling stations in 12 of Chechnya's districts. 

 Moscow launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya in August last year after separatists invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly carried out a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other Russian cities which claimed over 300 lives.
