MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency reported. The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic. The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics. ``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is preparing for some massive combat action.'' Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in kidnappings, killings, and theft. Maskhadov, who declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards. Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service, and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow. Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended in political deadlock. ``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the Interfax news agency. ``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny will occur at a high level. In that period, many bitter problems have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of Russia and Chechnya.'' Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago. Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the Chechen republic and the North Caucuses ... and consistently implement it,'' news agencies said. Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed Russia for Chechnya's present situation. Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document ``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,'' he told the Interfax news agency. Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were released, the Interfax news agency said. One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said. (nw/mr/ls)
