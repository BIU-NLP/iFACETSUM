MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- By Wednesday, Russia have detained more than 200 people in Chechnya and its neighboring republic of Dagestan on suspicions of involving in the terrorist blasts Sunday night, which caused over 100 person casualties to Russian troops. 

 About 50 persons have been detained in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, eight of whom may have taken part in the suicide bombing in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky on Chechnya told an interview in Moscow Wednesday. 

 He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks. 

 Meanwhile, 168 Chechens were detained in a large-scale police operation in the town of Khasavyurt in Dagestan Tuesday, the Interfax news agency cited the Dagestani Interior Ministry press service as saying Wednesday. 

 The center said the suspects' identities and affiliation with rebel units are being verified. 

 Yastrzhembsky said he does not expect any end to federal operations in Chechnya in one or two months, since "the long survival and resistance of the bands' leaders exert a moral, psychological and political influence on part of the Chechen population." 

 "As long as those men, such as Basayev, Khattab, Barayev, remain at large, we can expect a stealthy attack at any time," he said, adding that neutralizing these men is the main purpose of the current federal special operations. 

 According to the military's data, the rebels continue to recruit replacements from local populations and still have some 1, 500-2000 fighters, said Yastrzhembsky.
