MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel Chechnya from midnight (2000 GMT) today and start a partial withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist fighters would be hit hard if they stage "terrorist" attacks. 

 Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from "peaceful areas" to the Chechen border areas. 

 The initiative, approved by the Russian Security Council on March 15, is intended to end the 15-month fighting in the mountainous region of Chechnya and boost Yeltsin's chances of re-election in June. 

 He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels. 

 "Of course we will not tolerate terrorist actions. Responses to them will be adequate. The security of Russian citizens must be strictly maintained," he said. 

 Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech. 

 He said the main problem remaining is the status of the rebel republic and stressed that Chechnya must stay within the Russian Federation. 

 Yeltsin offered to resume talks with the separatist fighters through intermediaries. Negotiations broke down amid mutual recriminations last December after a shaky ceasefire collapsed. 

 "The main condition under which negotiations on the status in Chechnya could be started is normalizing the situation in the republic and establishing peace, calm and stability there," Yeltsin said. 

 Meanwhile, the president said Russia may grant amnesty to combatants of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, but said it would exclude those who have committed grave war crimes. 

 Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev.
