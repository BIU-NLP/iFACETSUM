MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there. 

 Rebel command headquarters, bases and storage facilities near the villages of Zebir-yurt, Pervomaiskoye, Raduzhnoye and Dolinsky were targeted in the latest raids, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry. 

 In addition, a radio station of the Severny airport and a bridge near the village of Chishki were also destroyed, the press service said. 

 Federal troops "blocked off 23 villages in the Chechen districts of Shelkovsky, Naursky and Nadterechny," the service said. 

 The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. Authorities believe Chechen rebels masterminded the terrorist attacks. 

 Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of federal troops in Chechnya, said Friday that the first stage of the counter-terrorist operation has been successfully completed and that federal troops have assumed control over one third of the Chechen territory. 

 "We created such circumstances that (militants) should expect us anywhere, any time. This is what's happening now," he said. 

 The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative, Kazantsev said. 

 As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby. 

 The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations put the total number of Chechen refugees at over 156,000, Interfax said. 

 The situation is especially difficult in the tiny republic of Ingushetia where over 147,000 refugees are concentrated. 

 The Federal Migration Service says the number of refugees may eventually rise to 300,000. 

 Authorities are rushing tents, clothes, food, medicines and other humanitarian aid supplies to the refugees.
