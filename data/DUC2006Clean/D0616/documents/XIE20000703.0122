MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels committed five terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding 74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced. 

 According to Interfax, Russian federal forces have blocked roads leading to the city of Argun and prepared for a "mopping up" operation after a violent apartment bloc explosion by the terrorists killed at least 25 and wounded 81 there overnight. 

 Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military, but Yastrzhembsky said it's "nothing new." 

 Maskhadov demands that "airstrikes and artillery attacks be stopped," and that "the troops subsequently be completely withdrawn from Chechnya" and "the military commanders, who have been directing operations in Chechnya, be put on international trial." 

 The separatist leader also said that if the Russian authorities present evidence showing that Chechen people have something to do with the bombings of apartment houses in Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buynaksk, he is prepared to hand over the suspects to the courts " under the control of international organizations." 

 Maskhadov's address does not contain anything new, Yastrzhembsky reiterated. "I can only repeat that any negotiations with Maskhadov are possible only on the issues of surrender and stopping resistance."
