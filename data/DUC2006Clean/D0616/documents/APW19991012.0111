GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks. 

 Both the Russians and the Chechens have been fortifying fixed positions in recent days, but neither side has launched any major offensives. 

 The Russians have been relying mostly on their big artillery guns. They were hammering two areas north of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, this morning. The echo of the exploding shells could be heard throughout the city. The Russians were also methodically shelling near the western town of Bamut, which has been under attack for several days. 

 The Russian Defense Ministry cited five regions in central, eastern and western Chechnya that were hit in artillery and air raids in the previous 24 hours. 

 The shelling was the latest development in a conflict that began this summer, when Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded neighboring Dagestan twice with the aim of setting up an Islamic state. They also are suspected in four Russian apartment bombings in September that killed about 300 people. 

 Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya two weeks ago, raising fears of another all-out war there. During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill. It won effective independence for itself, but was left devastated and lawless. 

 Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that the Russian aim of establishing a security zone in Chechnya ``is close to completion.'' 

 ``The ultimate objective is not only to form the security zone, but to destroy armed gangs,'' he said while on a visit to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported. Government forces ``will not stop, but will carry on tasks to eliminate gangs and terrorist groups.'' 

 Although Russian troops have held off mounting a ground attack on the capital, Russia has shown little inclination to negotiate an end to the fighting. 

 For now, the front line is largely defined by the Terek River, which flows across the northern third of Chechnya, forming a natural defense barrier. 

 The Russians control the sparsely populated plains to the north of the river, though the Chechens still hold a few positions. The Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's eastern border. 

 The Defense Ministry said that two of Chechnya's most prominent warlords, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, were both planning terrorist attacks inside Russia. Raduyev intended to target Russian nuclear facilities, while Basayev was training women militants to carry out attacks in southern Russia, the ministry claimed, without citing any evidence. 

 More than 155,000 Chechens have fled since the fighting began, with most heading to Ingushetia, an impoverished region on Chechnya's western border. 

 Humanitarian aid has been slow in arriving, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Moscow said the next convoy of assistance was being delayed due to ``the very slow distribution of aid already delivered,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 

 The Emergency Situations Ministry said it was flying 52 tons of baby food, canned meat, sugar and other supplies into the region on Tuesday.
