MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Federal fighter jets continued their bombing raids over the breakaway republic of Chechnya Friday, hitting oil tanks, refineries and radio and television transmission facilities near Grozny, the regional capital, Russian medial reports said. 

 Air force commander Anatoly Kornukov said federal aircraft will strike at Chechen guerrillas wherever they may be. 

 "The actions of Russia's air force are in compliance with a program approved by the General Staff of the Russian armed forces," the Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying. 

 "Our main task is to rule out the possibility of new provocations on the (Chechnya's) administrative border with Daghestan, Ingushetia, and the Stavropol and Krasnodar territories. We must not allow aggression to repeat," he said. 

 Islamic militants from Chechnya launched two waves of assaults on Daghestan since August. Federal troops drove out the rebels at both times. 

 The rebel incursions and several terrorist explosions that claimed the lives of more than 300 people in several major Russian cities, including Moscow, have steeled the authorities' resolve to deal heavy blows to the militants in Chechnya. 

 "Strikes were inflicted on several oil refineries to disrupt the separatists' oil supplies and hamper their maneuvers in and outside Chechnya," Kornukov said. 

 Federal aircraft destroyed an An-2 plane and a radar station near Grozny's airport on Thursday. The station "controlled airspace over Chechnya and was a source of increased danger for federal aviation," Kornukov said. 

 "We are resolutely minded and will be fulfilling the tasks facing us until we eliminate the guerrillas," he said. 

 Meanwhile, Aslan Maskhadov, president of the Chechen republic, has urged Moscow to stop the bombing raids and go to the negotiating table. 

 "A pending catastrophe in the North Caucasus can be averted and thousands of Russians and Chechens can be saved if Russia's leadership consents to resolve problems at the negotiating table by political methods," Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying Friday. 

 He said the intensified air strikes against Chechnya are "a waste of effort, means and time" and that "it will all boil down to negotiations anyway." 

 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Kazakhstan, said the federal bomb attacks would be made solely on terrorist bases. 

 "We will be after them everywhere. If we track them in a lavatory, forgive me for saying so, we will do them in there," Interfax quoted Putin as saying.
