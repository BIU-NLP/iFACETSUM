 EDITORIAL-ELIAN _ Janet Reno clarified Elian Gonzales' legal situation by brushing aside Florida judge's interference. Immigration, after all, is a federal matter. Now she needs to expedite adjudication. Elian has been separated from his father long enough. Besides, opportunists are preparing to confer U.S. citizenship on Elian when Congress reconvenes Jan. 24. (Atlanta Constitution). 

 EDITORIAL-TEENS _ Raise the driving age to 17. (Atlanta Constitution). 8. 

 BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I surrender.

I'm waving the white flag and joining the crowd. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED 

 MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Democrats who controlled redistricting of the Texas Senate last decade did such a good job of packing Republican-leaning districts with Republican voters that none of the six Republicans seeking re-election this year drew Democratic opposition.

Few figures of such note have been missed by such a wide mark by their caricatures. (John Young is opinion page editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
