MIAMI BEACH _ After a day of false starts and confusion, Attorney General Janet Reno jetted to Miami late Wednesday and met with the Florida relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez in a last-ditch bid to break the long-running stalemate over the boy. 

 ``She wants to do anything possible to resolve this,'' said Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin. ``She realizes it's a tall order, but believes she may be the one who can do it.'' 

 A spokesman for the Miami relatives, who have complained repeatedly that top federal officials have never listened to their side of the controversy, called Reno's visit a ``good sign.'' 

 Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in the Washington, D.C. area, where he has been staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat since his arrival from Cuba last week. There were unconfirmed reports that he might join in Reno's meeting with his Miami relatives via telephone. 

 But Gonzalez told supporters Wednesday that he has grown exasperated with the repeated delays in gaining custody of his son. 

 ``He said, 'I came here seven days ago, I came to get my boy, I watch him on TV and they still haven't brought him to me,''' said the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head of the National Council of Churches, who met with Gonzalez Wednesday. 

 Accompanied by Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner, Reno arrived in Miami about 6 p.m. (ET) on a mission to resolve the standoff peacefully, hoping to avoid sending federal marshals to retrieve the boy in the face of angry Cuban exile protestors. Justice Department officials have prepared a letter ordering the family to turn the boy over _ perhaps as early as Thursday at an airport north of Miami _ in case the family fails to cooperate. 

 The meeting took place at the Miami Beach home of Barry University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, who hosted a dramatic reunion between Elian and his two Cuban grandmothers in January. 

 Elian and his Miami relatives moved to O'Laughlin's home at mid-day Wednesday in an effort to escape the tension surrounding the family's tiny Little Havana home. Boisterous crowds of Cuban exiles have staged an around-the-clock vigil outside the home for much of the past week, and have vowed to form a human chain to keep the boy from being removed. 

 About 75 protestors jeered as Reno's motorcade pulled up to O'Laughlin's home at 6:40 p.m., with some holding signs depicting Reno with devil's horns. Miami Beach police erected metal fencing to keep the demonstrators on the far side of a divided road in front of the home, and dozens of officers patrolled the area. 

 Elian's Miami relatives have been unwilling to turn the boy over without assurances that he would not be quickly taken back to Cuba. They have also demanded that Elian be allowed to go home with them after any initial meeting with his father. 

 The rush of events came after a failed attempt at a family conference late Tuesday. About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father. 

 Within an hour, however, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, backed out, saying that Elian feared his father and that the two sides apparently misunderstood the terms for the meeting. Gonzalez said he learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family refused to do that. 

 Although the quickening pace seemed to indicate the standoff might soon be resolved, there was still a chance for further delays. Without the family's cooperation, Reno was expected to send the letter informing them when and where Elian should be turned over. 

 If the family failed to abide by the letter, Justice Department officials said they would probably go to a federal court seeking an order that they cooperate. It was unclear how long it might take to obtain such an order. 

 The Miami relatives might also try a last-second court move, perhaps asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta for an emergency injunction blocking the hand-over. The family's appeal of their lawsuit in the case is pending in that court, scheduled to be heard on May 11. 

 It also remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would remain in the United States once he is reunited with his son. He has said he would be willing to stay pending the legal appeal if the Miami family voluntarily turned over his son, and if an entourage of Elian's teachers, classmates and others could join him from Cuba. 

 According to members of a team of mental health experts appointed by Reno to help ease the boy's transition, Reno and INS officials want both sides of the family to go to a secure, neutral location for an extended reunion. 

 ``INS proposed that the families come together at a neutral location without any outside people present and that they might remain together for one or two weeks,'' Dr. Jerry Wiener told CNN. Wiener and the other team members met with Juan Miguel Gonzalez last weekend and briefly with Elian's Miami relatives on Monday. 

 ``Elian would see that some peace would be made, and the Miami family would be able to continue to have a relationship with him,'' Wiener said. 

 But whether the Miami family would cooperate remained to be seen. 

 Before Reno arrived, O'Laughlin made brief remarks to the press, indicating that the family may be coming to grips with the likelihood of losing their long battle to keep Elian in the U.S. 

 ``I think the family is becoming more reconciled in facing what perhaps could be pain,'' O'Laughlin said.
