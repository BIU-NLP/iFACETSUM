 ELIAN _ MIAMI _ Both sides in the Elian Gonzales case remained defiant Friday as they awaited the decision of a federal appeals court on whether the 6-year-old Cuban rafter must be transferred to the custodianship of his father. Large crowds remained outside the Little Havana home where the boy is staying with relatives. But in Washington, there were indications the government's patience is wearing thin. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner said the relatives are ``not in compliance with the law'' and vowed the feds will take ``appropriate'' action ``when we're ready.''
