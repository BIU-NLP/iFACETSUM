MIAMI _ With tensions rising and officials warning the city may explode in protest, the showdown over 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez racheted to an even higher level late Wednesday as officials in Havana said Elian's father could come to the United States. 

 The development came as negotiations between federal immigration officials and Elian's Miami relatives remained at an impasse. U.S. officials postponed a deadline for revoking the boy's custody status. 

 After months of angry rhetoric, Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he would allow Juan Miguel Gonzalez to come to the United States along with some of his son's school classmates and a team of psychologists to live with Elian until the court battle over the boy's fate ends, CNN reported. 

 There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials about the proposed trip, and it was not clear if or when the visit would take place. 

 U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials ended a tense five-hour meeting Wednesday night with Elain's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, who has cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea in November. 

 The meeting centered on an INS demand that Gonzalez pledge to turn the boy over for a return to Cuba if the family loses its court fight to keep Elian in the United States. 

 Immigration officials emerged from their Miami offices about 9 p.m. EST, saying the meeting had reached no conclusion and would resume Thursday. They postponed until Friday a deadline for revoking Elian's parole, which could mean he might soon be taken away from his Miami family, perhaps for a return to Cuba. 

 Meanwhile, Miami's Cuban exiles held a huge rally in the neighborhood known as Little Havana. Thousands of people gathered in the darkness, shining flashlights into the sky and vowing to continue their protests against any effort to return Elian to Cuba. 

 Earlier Wednesday, more than a hundred protesters milled outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home, chanting, praying and vowing to form a human chain to keep the boy here. 

 ``We are here to show the world that we're united and that we're not going to allow Elian to go back to Cuba,'' said Hortensia Prado(cq), one of the protesters. 

 In an apparent prelude to what might come if the government moves to take the boy, a convoy of dump trucks chugged down the narrow streets of the neighborhood, horns blaring to the cheers of the protesters. The drivers vowed to block all the streets leading to the home. 

 Meanwhile, local officials lashed out at Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton, warning that Miami's Cuban exiles may burst into angry protest if Elian is removed before his court appeals are exhausted. 

 ``They're provoking the community,'' Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said of Clinton and Reno. ``They keep pushing and pushing the envelope and when it explodes, no one is going to be able to control it.'' 

 At a noon press conference, Penelas and 20 other local officials vowed that local police would make no effort to assist federal officers should they try to remove the boy before his court case is finished. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush also issued a statement saying no state officers would assist, either. 

 After critics said the mayor was essentially inviting the community to protest, Penelas issued another statement saying police would not tolerate disruptions in the streets, such as the ones that erupted in January after the initial decision by federal officials that Elian should go back to Cuba. 

 Clinton responded to the comments at a Washington news conference by saying, ``I like the mayor very much but I believe in the rule of law.'' 

 Although the city appeared on the brink of some sort of outburst, immigration officials repeated Wednesday that even if the 9 a.m. deadline comes and they revoke Elian's parole, they do not plan to immediately go the Lazaro Gonzales's home and forcibly remove the boy. 

 ``The obligation is on them,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said in a television interview. ``They have said they intend to be law-abiding, and we are relying on them to be law-abiding.'' 

 Elian has been at the center of an international tug of war since he was found floating in an inner tube off Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank as they fled Cuba. 

 Immigration officials immediately placed the boy in the home of his great-uncle, but in January, federal officials ruled that Elian should be returned to his father. 

 The Miami family then filed a federal court suit to challenge the federal decision and to request an asylum hearing for the boy, but last week a Miami federal judge ruled against them. The family then appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which on Monday set oral arguments for May 8. 

 Underlying the complicated standoff is the fact that since he was rescued at sea, Elian has been legally in the custody of Reno. Under federal law, the attorney general has the authority to ignore the pending court appeal and send Elian home to Cuba immediately. 

 Reno has said that she would allow the appeal to be heard, but has insisted that Lazaro Gonzalez sign a statement promising to voluntarily turn Elian over if the family loses the appeal. 

 Despite edging up the pressure on the family, federal officials have said they are reluctant to forcibly take the boy against the family's will. But the family seems adamantly opposed to turning the boy over until all legal channels have been exhausted, including a possible hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court. 

 Underscoring the growing drama was the volatility of Miami's exile community, where Elian has become a symbol of the never-ending battle against Fidel Castro. The boy has been the subject of poems, paintings and an almost religious fervor, with some people recently flocking to a bank near Lazaro Gonzalez's home where a figure has appeared in a glass window that many believe resembles the Virgin Mary. 

 Such intense feelings left worried police officials planning for the worst. 

 ``I have great concerns that I can't see a peaceful resolution to this situation,'' said Miami Police Chief William O'Brien.
