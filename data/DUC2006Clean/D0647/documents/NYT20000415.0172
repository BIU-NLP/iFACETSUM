 CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ Demonstrators sang and prayed outside the home where Elian Gonzales is staying as all sides in the custody battle waited for a federal appeals court ruling that could lead to the boy's reunion with his father. The court action could come at any time. (Williams, Cox News Service) MOVED 

 ELIAN-CUBANS _ The legendary clout of Miami's exile community has never been so obvious as during its spirited, unified standoff against the U.S. government and Janet Reno, a former Miami hero. Is this the last hurrah of the exile community as a political force or the beginning of something even more powerful? The buzz has been that since the death of long-time power broker Jorge Mas Canosa and the arrival of more moderate rivals to his Cuban-American National Foundation, the community clout had begun to wane. The Clinton administration has managed to play the different groups off against each other more than once. But now even the naysayers are taking notice of what a motivated exile community can do when truly aroused. Elian has united this often never-quite-so-monolithic community as never before. And so far, they've managed to thumb their nose successfully at the full might of the federal government. Whither the storied Miami exile enclave? (Douthat, Palm Beach Post). 25. MOVED 

 WASHINGTON 

 IMF-PROTESTS _ WASHINGTON _ Police staged a pre-emptive raid and closed the headquarters of world finance protests Saturday, saying the aging warehouse was unsafe and claiming they found ingredients to make a firebomb. The move angered protestors as police braced for the first of two days of scheduled mass demonstrations on Sunday. Large sections of downtown Washington were fenced off and thousands of police stood ready. (Dart/Schulktz, Cox News Service) MOVED 

 SCHOOL-SAFETY-1STLD _ WASHINGTON _ Some 3,000 students at Montgomery Blair High School evacuated their school in Washington's Maryland suburbs at noon recently and rambled three blocks to the grounds of another school. Meanwhile, security teams scoured the building. It was all part of a three-hour drill on how to escape shootings or explosions, part of a national trend toward protectiveness unequalled since the 1950's, when millions of school children took part in ``duck and cover'' drills designed to help them survive nuclear attacks. Experts talk about what else has changed _ and hasn't changed _ nationally since the shootings at Columbine High School nearly one year ago. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 

 EDs: MOVED Thursday. 

 GORE-MEADOWLANDS _ EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With Earth Day fast approaching, Vice President Al Gore faces a situation here that could test his environmental credentials. The Mills Corp. of Virginia, whose executives and associates have given $43,000 to the Gore presidential campaign, want to develop a shopping center on 90 acres of wetlands in the Meadowlands here. But the mall project is opposed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. a prominent environmentalist who has endorsed Gore as ``the strongest environmentalist running for the White House since Teddy Roosevelt.'' The Meadowlands Mills project has thus become a possible litmus test for Gore's environmental agenda. (Shepard, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS and LOCATOR MAP. 

 EDs: MOVED Thursday. 

 OSCILLATE _ WASHINGTON _ Now that it's becoming clear that the tropical Pacific Ocean's inability to make up its mind about El Ninos and La Ninas has something to do with the severity of Atlantic hurricanes, atmospheric scientists say an even bigger climate oscillation may be occurring. Conditions in the north Pacific seem to be switching from ``North Pacific Oscillation 1'' to ``North Pacific Oscillation 2.'' And what that shift lacks in colorful Spanish terminology, it more than makes up for in bad weather: several decades of worse-than-normal hurricane seasons. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

 EDs: MOVED Wednesday. 

 CHICKEN-NUGGETS-1STLD _ WASHINGTON _ Two Gold Kist Inc. poultry processing plants in Alabama that supply chicken to school lunch programs nationwide were overwhelmed earlier this year by diseased poultry, federal investigators have reported. ``There were so many birds condemned they they were filling up the 'USDA condemned' barrel and spilling onto the floor,'' the report, obtained by Cox Newspapers, says of conditions at Gold Kist's Boaz plant. (Jaspin, Cox News Service). 

 EDs: MOVED Friday. 

 NATIONAL 

 FREAKNOT _ The raunchy street party that held Atlanta hostage the third weekend in April throughout the 1990s was nowhere to be found Saturday. But an offshoot of Freaknik _ the National Job Fair _ was thriving, bringing an estimated 50,000 people to the Georgia World Congress Center. (Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 

 COLUMBINE-MAIN _ The jolt of gunfire that shattered the halls of Columbine High School still splits the air over Colorado's amber plains, roars over purple mountains, drowns the cacophony of its crystal rivers and clatters down red canyons. Many people, including several who wrote us, have thoughts, hopes, memories and fears about Columbine as we approach the first-year anniversary. (Grand Junction Daily Sentinel). 65. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED 

 WITH 

 COLUMBINE-HEALING _ Forget all the talk about ``closure.'' The fact is that the students, teachers, friends and families of victims may move on but a sense of loss will always be with them. How has the anniversary reopened wounds? How are students and families dealing with the stress of the anniversary? How have victims of other tragedies, i.e. Oklahoma City bombing, survived and what lessons might they offer for Columbine? (Sauer, Grand Junction Daily Sentinel). 40. MOVED 

 DAVIDIANS-COMPOUND _ WACO, Texas _ An overview of Mount Carmel, an unappetizing piece of almost barren property now virtually synonymous throughout the world with Waco. What was there then, what was left behind, construction of a new church, dispute over property ownership, its symbolic value for Davidians and their sympathizers. (England, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED 

 WITH 

 DAVIDIANS-MEMORIAL _ WACO, Texas _ A look at the plans of Davidians and sympathizers to mark the April 19 anniversary of the 1993 fire. There will be a service at the compound April 19, probably during morning hours. (England/Witherspoon, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED 

 POLITICS 

 GORE-TEXAS _ Fifth-worst poverty rate. Second-worst hunger problem. Second in the number of children without health insurance. Forty-fifth in homeownership. These are the Texas statistics that Vice President Al Gore trotted out last week when Gov. George W. Bush unveiled health-care and housing proposals designed to cement his image as a ``compassionate conservative.'' Though not all of Gore's numbers withstand scrutiny, Texas almost always fares poorly when it is compared to other states on social services. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED 

 WITH 

 BUSHPOLLS _ Last week, while Al Gore was touting numbers he believes show that George W. Bush is an under-achieving governor who never should be president the Bush campaign was shopping numbers they believe indicate Gore never will be president. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED 

 DEMS-HOLLYWOOD _ In a rare joint fundraising appearance with the Hollywood elite, Bill Clinton and Al Gore raised more than $2 million last night (Saturday) at the historic Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. We take a look at Gore's ties to Hollywood and why the Republicans are having trouble raising much money in Hollywood. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30. MOVED 

 POL-TICKER _ A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from Cox staff and wire reports. (Cox News Service) ETA: 9 p.m. EDT. 

 OPED/EDITORIAL 

 TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Libel was the issue in a London courtroom but history was on trial. British historian David Irving had charged that American historian Deborah Lipstadt libeled him when she wrote that he is a Holocaust denier, an anti-Semite and a Hitler apologist. History won. Be glad. Just don't be complacent. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY. 

 KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Eds: Howard Kleinberg is monitoring events in Miami today and will try to write for Sunday after the Elian situation becomes clear (or doesn't). MOVED (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.) 

 GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Anticipating a wartime boom in aluminum demand, Alcoa expanded rapidly, winding up in 1945 with 90 percent of the U.S. raw ingot market. Nobody claimed mighty Alcoa had achieved its monopoly by illegal means, jacked up prices or harmed customers. But that didn't save Alcoa from being broken up. The precedent is there for Microsoft. (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY. 

 LIFESTYLE 

 SWIMSUIT_ Finding the perfect swimsuit. In this Olympic year, we need suits that go the distance. Gold, silver, bronze. Red, white and blue. Neons, florals, racing stripes... Olympic swimmers, divers, water polo players and synchronized swimmers don't have much say about what they wear to the pool. Their primary considerations are patriotic and athletic, but those aren't taken lightly. (Among sprinters and distance swimmers, there's currently a controversy brewing over the use of neck-to-ankle suits _ a look that is no doubt as hard to tug on as it is to pull off.) (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). WITH PHOTOS and LAYOUTS. MOVED 

 ESSAYIST-PROFILE _ YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. _ For 20 years, Steve Harvey, a professor at Young Harris College in North Georgia, wrote poems before finding his real voice in the personal essay. In two collections, ``A Geometry of Lilies: Life and Death in an American Family'' and ``Lost in Translation,'' he writes with fluent ease about love and marriage, about change and loss. His tone is by turns winsome and reflective. ``People ask me what my books are about,'' he says. ``It's very hard to say.'' He will write of his kids ganging up on him (``I marvel at the transparent guile of their planning huddles, the determined looks as they gather courage for the synchronized assault, their reckless confidence as they throw their bodies at their father.'') or of discovering he is perfectly happy living without a television (``Our mind connects the dots, lending depth and perspective, and ultimately, meaning to the electronic trompe l'oeil of the tube. And yet, the experience sedates us, engaging just enough of our senses to lull us into a stupor.''). He writes what's on his mind, but what's on his mind always seems to lead somewhere else _ from the personal to what might be called the universal. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 57.

 CHICKENSOUP-MAIN _ A look at the proliferation of chicken soup books. There's chicken soup for the prisoner's soul, chicken soup cruises, where will it end? In world peace, says the author who started it all. (Grand Junction Daily Sentinel). 66. MOVED 

 WITH 

 CHICKENSOUP-SPOOF _ A spoof on ``Chicken Soup for the Chicken Soul.'' It was a beautiful summer day, one I'll never forget. The sun was round and gold like a big bowl of creamed corn. The sky was blue like Clean `n' Clear astringent face wash for sensitive skin. Fluffy puffs of clouds that looked like Farmer Brown's white hair where it sticks out the back of his baseball cap floated along like they had nowhere to go. Come to think of it, they probably didn't. (Grand Junction Daily Sentinel). 12. MOVED 

 PARENTING _ A parenting author claims her new book is a definitive decision-making guide for parents. A look at it and opinions of experts and parents. (Allmon, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED 

 ENTERTAINMENT-ARTS 

 CHARLES-OSGOOD _ NEW YORK _ A conversation with Charles Osgood, host of the critically acclaimed CBS program ``Sunday Morning,'' which continues to have an almost liturgical appeal. One reason may be because it has never varied from its initial conception: to be like a Sunday newspaper. (Hulbert, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. MOVED

 AUTO RACING 

 CAR-EARNHARDT _ Dale Earnhardt, who won both races at Talladega last year, is enjoying his best start in years. He won at Atlanta _ saved NASCAR _ almost caught up with Bobby Labonte at Rockingham, was leading at Bristol when he was knocked out by Kenny Irwin. Has this 48-year old found the fountain of youth? Or is it rejuvenation from competing against his son? Big E is in the top 5 of the standings and poised to compete for his eighth title, which would break a tie with Richard Petty for the most ever. Why is Earnhardt flourishing this year? (Levine, Cox News Service). 22. 

 SWIMMING 

 SWM-HALLOFFAME _ FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The Summer Olympics are several months and half a world away. Why wait for televised excitement in Sydney when you can visit the International Swimming Hall of Fame right now? (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post) MOVED
