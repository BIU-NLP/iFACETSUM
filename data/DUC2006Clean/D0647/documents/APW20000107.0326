CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return from Miami. 

 Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally matched the emotional content of angry demonstrations by Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely oppose a U.S. government decision to return Elian to his father's home here. 

 ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang. 

 Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea. 

 Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from crying. Telling the crowd of ``hard and difficult days'' suffered since the child was rescued at sea, Gonzalez said that ``our tears have given way to patriotic pride'' seeing tens of thousands turn out regularly demand Elian's return. 

 Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since fishermen found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on Thanksgiving Day. 

 Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the boy and want to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give Elian a better life off the communist island. 

 Gonzalez has demanded that his child be returned to him, and the U.S. government has ruled that the father and child should be reunited by next Friday, Jan. 14. 

 The rally in Cardenas was the most personal and emotional of many held since early December when President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the boy was returned to his father. 

 The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him since he was a baby. 

 In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly, two kites sailed high over the rally -- one of them flown by a boy named Julio. 

 It was imprinted with Elian's portrait and read, ``Julio claims you, Eliancito.'' 

 During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross. 

 Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, encouraged the crowd to keep protesting until is back with his father. 

 ``We cannot call a truce yet,'' Alarcon said, warning that exiles in Miami were trying to delay the child's return. ``We cannot let down our guard until the kidnapping of Elian comes to an end.'' 

 He also called to an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that he blamed for the custody flap. Under the law, any Cuban who reaches American soil has the right to stay and seek permanent residency. 

 ``The case of Elian Gonzalez is the most repugnant expression of this law,'' said Alarcon, Fidel Castro's top man on American policy issues. ``It is the most vulgar, the most cruel manipulation of a child ... really child abuse.'
