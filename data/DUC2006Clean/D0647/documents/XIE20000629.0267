HAVANA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The six-year old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez returned to his native land in Cuba by a chartered plane Wednesday with his father and other relatives, ending a seven- month long bitter custody battle. 

 Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, President of the Cuban National Assembly of People's Power, Elian's family members in Cuba and his classmates are among the several hundred people welcoming him at Jose Marti airport where the plane landed at 7.45 p.m. local time (2345 GMT). 

 The plane took off at Washington Dulles International Airport after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal by Elian relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States. 

 Elian's custody battle began after he survived a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other illegal Cuban migrants on November 22, 1999. The boy was soon in the center of a campaign to bring him back to Cuba by his father and relatives in Cuba and to keep him in the United States by his relatives in Miami. 

 Elian's return constitutes a major victory to President Fidel Castro and the Cuban people who have time and again demonstrated to demand the return of the shipwreck survivor boy to his Caribbean homeland in Cuba, observers here say.
