MIAMI _ The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy's father was ready to fly ``immediately'' to retrieve his son, while the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return the boy to Cuba. 

 In Miami, it remained far from clear whether the boy's relatives would give him up voluntarily or if the area's powerful Cuban exile community would try to prevent his return home, no matter what the family decided to do. 

 ``The passports are ready, and of course the airplane is ready,'' Castro said in a television broadcast from Havana that added another potentially volatile element to a political drama that has captured international attention and caused deep divisions within this country. 

 In a vivid indication of just how intense the situation has become, the mayors of 23 municipalities around Miami Wednesday declared that they would not help federal forces if they tried to take custody of Elian. 

 Elian's relatives here, along with their lawyers, met with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials for nearly five hours Wednesday night, and will resume talks Thursday. Earlier Wednesday, the Gonzalez family's spokesman said the family would not accede to the INS's key demand: that they agree in writing to surrender the boy if an appeals court orders that he be returned to his father. 

 Absent such a guarantee by Wednesday, immigration officials had threatened to revoke the boy's permission to remain in the United States and seek custody of him at 9 a.m. Thursday. But late Wednesday, they extended the deadline for 24 hours. 

 The family's defiant stance has set up a potentially explosive scenario in which federal marshals may have to be dispatched to the city's Little Havana section to remove the boy from the home of his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. 

 If anything like that happens, the area's mayors said at a press conference, they not only would refuse to provide any of their law enforcement personnel for support, but also would hold the Clinton administration accountable for the consequences. 

 ``We will not lend our . . . police officers or any other resources to assist the federal government in any way, shape, or form to inappropriately repatriate Elian Gonzalez to Cuba,'' said Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who spoke for himself and the mayors of 22 nearby towns. 

 ``If their continued provocation, in the form of unjustified threats to revoke the boy's parole, leads to civil unrest and violence, we are holding the federal government responsible, and specifically Janet Reno and the president of the United States, for anything that may occur in this community,'' he said. 

 Penelas, who is of Cuban descent, said the local authorities would maintain order if protests got out of control. But the mayors' extraordinary proclamation demonstrated how profoundly the differences over this issue have become in Southern Florida, where Cuban-Americans make up about one-third of the population. 

 They also served as a sort of official warning that widespread demonstrations, which may be difficult to control, may be inevitable if the INS carries out its promise to return Elian to his father, even if Juan Miguel Gonzales comes to this country to get his son, rather than waits for him in Cuba. 

 President Clinton seemed concerned Wednesday about both the prospect of violence and about the possibility that the Gonzalez family in Miami, members of the Cuban exile community, and local elected officials may be preparing to flout the federal government's authority. 

 ``I would hope that the law would be followed by everyone, including them,'' Clinton said at a press conference in Washington, referring to Elian's relatives. ``I don't think they should be singled out, and I don't think they should have extra pressure put on them, but on the other hand I think they should observe the rule of the law.'' 

 Castro's announcement came as a surprise primarily because Juan Gonzalez has said that he would go to the United States only after his son's case was resolved and the boy was ready to be taken back to Cuba. 

 Assuming that he follows through on the revised plan _ while the case is still in the courts and Elian still lives at his great-uncle's house _ it could help to resolve the conflict, since his relatives have said that they would be willing to give the boy to his father if he came to America. 

 But the political and emotional atmosphere here has grown far more heated since that suggestion was made, and the family's more recent comments have indicated that they may think Elian would be better off in this country regardless of what else happens. 

 In any event, some officials of the Cuban exile community have made it clear that they do not want the boy returned to Cuba and will stage protests to try to prevent that from happening. A convoy of large trucks, their drivers blaring their horns and shouting their support for Elian, circled the neighborhood in which the boy is living Wednesday and vowed to come back in greater numbers Thursday. 

 Moreover, individual Cuban-Americans said they were willing to form human blockades and even lay down their lives if necessary to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States. Elian has been with his relatives here since being rescued last Thanksgiving, laying on an inner tube in the waters off Florida; he was one of three survivors of an accident in which his mother and 10 other Cubans died. 

 ``They're going to have to kill everyone here,'' said Jose Prado, a retired General Motors worker, when asked what would happen if the federal government tried to return the boy to Cuba. Prado was one of scores of Cuban-Americans standing behind a police barracade near the Gonzalez home throughout the day Wednesday, showing support for Elian remaining here. 

 ``All these exiles are going to jump this fence and fight whatever we have to fight,'' said Olgalidia Garcia, a recent high school graduate, as about a dozen people surrounding her vigorously nodded in agreement. ``And we are going to block whatever we have to block.''
