WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba. 

 At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department to put its plan into effect. 

 Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost their court fight. 

 As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in November. 

 Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to resolve the situation. But Justice Department officials warned that they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts to return Elian to his father. 

 Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian in the United States. But they have declined to be more specific and to comply with the Justice Department's demand. 

 Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family will obey the law.'' But asked if that means that the family agrees to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them, Coffey said that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are far from that moment.'' He said that he thought the general statement that the family would comply with the law was ``more than sufficient.'' 

 Justice Department lawyers disagree, regarding the careful statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to resist. 

 Last week, David J. Kline, a lawyer in the Justice Department's immigration office, said that the government had the authority to terminate permission for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales to have temporary custody of the boy. But Kline said the agency would agree to that only if the relatives said clearly they would send Elian back three days after they lost in the appeals court unless they obtained an injunction from a court allowing them to file an expedited appeal with the Supreme Court. 

 Kline also demanded that Elian's family in Miami agree to an expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4. But the appeals court Monday may have made the department's case more difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule 

 Justice Department officials have grown increasingly impatient with the tactics of the family. Some officials said that they might well move to take control of Elian and send him back to Cuba while the appeals are not yet completed. 

 ``We have been more than generous,'' said one official. 

 The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami's large Cuban-American community have rallied to their cause. 

 Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to come to the United States capsized. Elian's mother and most of the other passengers drowned. 

 The efforts of the Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United States suffered a setback last week when a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the boy, concluding that a long, bitter legal battle was not in Elian's best interest.
