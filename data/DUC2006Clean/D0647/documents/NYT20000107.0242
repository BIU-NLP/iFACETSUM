MIAMI _ As the city's streets settled into an uneasy calm, the battle over six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez moved to court Friday with the boy's Miami relatives hoping to overturn a decision by federal immigration officials to send him back to his father in Cuba. 

 The high-profile case also drew attention in Washington, where Cuban-American members of Congress discussed strategies for keeping the boy here through legislative action, even as President Clinton confirmed his support for the decision that Elian should go back to Cuba. 

 ``I believe they followed the law,'' Clinton said of officials from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who ruled the boy belongs with his father. ``This is a volatile and difficult case. ... We need to keep this out of the political process as much as possible.'' 

 In Miami, the biggest news for many residents was the absence of a new round of protests like the ones that hampered traffic around the city on Thursday. Police arrested more than 100 people in those demonstrations, which temporarily blocked the street entrance to the Port of Miami and triggered some bloody scuffles between officers and protestors. 

 Cuban exile leaders had called for people all over Miami-Dade County to drive at 15 mph Friday to tie up traffic. By late in the day, however, there were only a couple of reports of such actions, which police quickly quelled by pulling over and arresting the slow-moving drivers. 

 Undaunted, activists called for a day-long slowdown Monday at Miami International Airport, hoping to win more media attention for their cause. Airport officials said they would be ready with teams of police and tow trucks to stop any attempts to block traffic. 

 ``We will not let the airport be shut down,'' said the airport's director, Carlos Alvarez. ``We will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the airport open.'' 

 The developments came as the Jan. 14 deadline set by immigration officials for returning Elian to Cuba loomed. The boy, who survived a boat capsizing that killed his mother and nine others on Thanksgiving Day, played with a puppy outside the Little Havana home of his relatives Friday, seemingly oblivious to the horde of media camped out on a nearby street. 

 In Cuba, residents of his hometown, Cardenas, held a massive rally, decrying U.S. imperialism and the delays in Elian's return. His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, appeared, saying he has no plans to travel to Miami, as his relatives here have requested. 

 ``I deeply appreciate all the people all over the world who have come together to condemn the psychological torture we're being put through,'' he said. 

 As Gonzalez was speaking, his relatives in Miami appeared in a county Family Court, with Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, asking for temporary custody of the boy. If the court grants the petition, Gonzales plans to request a federal asylum hearing. 

 Legal experts have given the strategy little hope, saying the decision to send the boy back to his father is firmly grounded in both U.S. and international law. 

 It was unclear what the impact of possible congressional action on the case might be. Cuban-American representatives from South Florida asked House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., to issue a subpoena requiring the boy to testify before his committee, a move that would bar Elian from leaving this country. 

 Burton said he would seriously consider the subpoena. 

 Meanwhile, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said he will continue to push for an act of Congress that would declare the boy a U.S. citizen, thereby changing his immigration status. 

 With events moving forward on several fronts, it appears the battle over the boy is far from over. 

 Even as his father spoke in Cuba, thanking Fidel Castro for his support, Elian's Miami relatives claimed in court papers that going back to Cuba would amount to psychological abuse for the boy. 

 ``Elian has repeatedly stated that he does not want to return to Cuba,'' their petition stated.
