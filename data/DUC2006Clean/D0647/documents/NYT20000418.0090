 CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ As both sides in the Elian Gonzales custody case await a federal appeals court ruling, the mayor of Miami flies to Washington to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno. Meanwhile, Elian's Miami relatives react with anger to a report by a pediatrician who is advising the federal government.

 MIDEAST-JOURNAL _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Palestinian Jihad Mubarak was destined to be a fighter in the war against the Israelis. Instead, he sells them antiques. His uncle, a doctor in the Jordanian army, delivered him on May 1, 1948, two weeks before the Arab states attacked the new state of Israel. Name him Jihad, the uncle ordered. It's Arabic for a Muslim sacred cause or, in this case, a Holy War. Jihad is an unusual name for a Christian, but with war coming, it seemed appropriate. But Mubarak, turning 52 this week, has focused his life on beautiful antiques, cars and, he admits, women. When the 1967 war began and the19-year-old Mubarak might have fought, the same uncle that delivered him gave a medical excuse out of the war. Jolly and easy going, the gray-haired Mubarak sells antiques to Israelis, and has never fought them. His nondescript store, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, is one of the most peaceful spots I've found here, a place where Israelis, Arabs and foreign visitors browse over collectibles from Europe, Syria and made in Bethlehem.

 ESTATE-TAX _ Efforts to end the estate tax are gaining momentum in Congress. Democrats say eliminating the tax would give billions of dollars to the nation's wealthiest people, but Republicans say ``death tax'' reform is necessary to save family businesses and farms. (Sherman, Cox News Service). 35. 

 INTERNET-POLITICS _ WASHINGTON _ Traditionally, presidential candidates have either tightly controlled the process of writing their party's political platforms or else ignored planks that didn't suit their campaign needs. But the Internet has now made possible far broader citizen activist involvement than ever before in the drafting process. Both the Democrats and Republicans are finding new ways of using these high-tech tools in writing their platforms. (Glass, Cox News Service). 20.

 CIVILRIGHTS-ISLAM _ WHITE HALL, Ala. _ State and federal governments are planning to build an interpretive center in White Hall, Alabama, to commemorate major events of the civil rights movement. But the government's plan pales in comparison to a proposal for a $47 million rural Islamic complex for the tiny town drawn up by accused cop killer Jamil Abdulla Al-Amin.
