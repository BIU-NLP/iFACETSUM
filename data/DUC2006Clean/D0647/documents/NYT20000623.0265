The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba. It now appears he could go home as early as next week. 

 The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta unanimously rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago. The panel had upheld the US Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to allow an asylum hearing for Elian, saying only the child's father could make such a request. 

 The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to the US Supreme Court. But the justices in Washington are widely seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so, both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and because the three-judge panel cited a Supreme Court ruling as the rationale for its own decision. 

 Analysts said the only surprise about Friday's seemingly conclusive announcement from Atlanta was that it had taken so long to reach. 

 ``It feels like it's been forever getting here, but it's absolutely the right decision,'' said Karen Jacobsen, a specialist in refugee and immigration policy at the Fletcher School of International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. 

 ``It's in keeping with American law and immigration policy. . .and it's in keeping with what most people believe about families: that a child belongs with his parent, and not with people he hardly knows.'' 

 The 12 judges of the 11th Circuit evidently shared with many observers of the case the feeling that it was time to write the last chapter of a saga that has captivated the nation and sparked international controversy since Elian was discovered floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast last November. He had survived, with two others, a disastrous boat trip from Cuba in which his mother and 10 others drowned. 

 After noting that an injunction preventing Elian's father from leaving the United States with his son expires at 4 p.m. Wednesday, the five-page ruling said the appeals court will not entertain any more requests for a stay. The word ``not'' appeared in oversized and boldfaced type. 

 Reaction to Friday's development was muted, especially compared to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal defeats for Elian's relatives have prompted. The Cuban-American community in southern Florida appeared quiet, and there was no hint of gloating from anyone on the winning side 

 ``We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in Washington. ``Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together.'' 

 Greg Craig, the attorney for Elian's father, released a short statement that relayed the same sentiments. It said, in part: 

 ``We believe that the INS decision to recognize the right of Juan Miguel Gonzalez to speak for his son Elian is consistent with the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions. We are gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to affirm those values and those traditions.'' 

 Craig added that the elder Miguel and his family, who have been living in suburban Washington awaiting a final disposition of the case, ``look forward to resuming a normal life.'' 

 Elian has been in his father's custody since April 22, when federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great uncle and cousins in the Little Havana section of Miami. 

 His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their effort to prevent his return to Cuba, had argued that all 12 judges on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling. 

 But the full court adamantly disagreed. Seven of the dozen judges had to approve reconsideration in order for it to occur, but none even asked for a vote on the question.
