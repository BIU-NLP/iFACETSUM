 ROSA PARKS: AMERICA'S NO. 1 HEROINE OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES OF 20TH CENTURY _ ``Since its earliest days as a nation, America has been blessed with true heroes and heroines, which has caused me to reject the temptation to join in naming the single `greatest man or woman of the century,''' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``But based on my 50 years in journalism and several decades of trying to become an unbiased student of American history, I can't resist this nomination of Rosa Parks as `The No. I Heroine of My 20th Century.'' In this commentary, Jarrett recounts Parks' achievements and milestones and the effects they had on the civil-rights movement. 

 ANOTHER CENSUS COUNTDOWN? _ The League of United Latin American Citizens and other organizations hope to educate Hispanics on the importance of an accurate population tally. In this commentary from Hispanic Business magazine, Derek Reveron writes about the importance of being counted. ``The federal government uses census figures to determine where and how to apportion funds among county and local jurisdictions. The feds also employ the figures to form domestic policy and monitor civil rights laws. State and local governments use the census numbers in redistricting,'' he writes. 

 NATIVE-AMERICANS HOPE FOR A NEW WORLD OF ENLIGHTENMENT _ A brilliant light reportedly shone on a recent September night in Navajo country. Some native people believe the unexplained glow represents a time shift more significant than the dawn of the new millennium. Chippewa writer Elisabeth Dietz, co-author of a book on Native-American prophecies called ``Now Is the Hour'' (Blue Dolphin, 1988), said she believes the light marks an emergence into another age, as foretold by her native elders. Columnist Karen Lincoln Michel writes about what Dietz describes as a ``spiritual rebirth'' for all people, not just Native-Americans. ``We're entering a new world of enlightenment,'' Dietz says. ``We've just come through a time where we've forgotten how to treat Mother Earth and each other. Now we have to let go of the aggression toward the Earth and learn to live in harmony.'' 

 EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS FOR GAYS LIKE US _ The Vermont Supreme Court, with its recent same-sex marriage decision, has given the gay community a rare opportunity _ the chance to ``persuade lawmakers to provide the full badge of citizenship by recognizing the freedom to marry,'' writes Columnist Chuck Colbert, who is spending the holidays in Arizona, with his domestic partner's family. Over time, Colbert and his partner have experienced full acceptance and inclusion within the extended family circle. ``We realize,'' he writes, ``that people of goodwill need a reasonable period of time to get comfortable with the m-word's applying to lesbian and gay couples. But personal discomfort should not hold back the Vermont legislature from doing the right thing: legalize same sex marriage.'' 

 FREEDOM AND HONOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE _ The drama of 10-year-old Elian Gonzales who survived five days in Atlantic waters after his refugee raft sunk, killing his mother, continues with Cuba's Fidel Castro demanding his return and the Clinton administration's wavering between justice and Castro. Should the mother's wishes be honored even though she drowned in her failed effort to bring the child to freedom? Or, should the White House bend to pressure from Cuba? ``The boy should stay here, as the mother wished for citizenship,'' writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.
