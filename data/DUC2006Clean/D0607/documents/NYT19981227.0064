BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for ``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said. 

 After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang, 42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group Human Rights in China, based in New York. 

 Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an independent labor union in 1989. This year, before his detention in July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried to register it with local officials. 

 Chinese authorities, fearing social unrest at a time of rising unemployment, appear to be especially fearful of any labor organizations outside Communist Party control, and of any efforts to link up disaffected workers with democracy campaigners. 

 Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to 13 years. 

 At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives. 

 The indictment specifically named a telephone interview Zhang gave last March to Radio Free Asia in which he discussed a protest against high taxes by 70 to 80 farmers in one Hunan county, and another incident in which a farmer who refused to pay a tax was killed. 

 Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county governments. 

 Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific. The Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media. 

 ``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from Washington Sunday. 

 In the March interview, Southerland said, journalists called Zhang to verify reports of the farmer protests and ``he didn't say anything that wasn't widely known _ certainly it wasn't national security information.'' 

 ``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find an excuse,'' Southerland said. Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts in native languages to eight countries where news is censored, frequently quotes Chinese residents on its programs, though does not use names when it appears the speaker would be endangered. 

 Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests. 

 In general, only those who have been actively involved in organizing the new political party or independent worker groups have been imprisoned for any length of time. In contrast to earlier decades, Chinese people today are fairly free to voice dissenting opinions in private _ so long as they do not act on them. 

 In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media, President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be ``annihilated in the early stages.'' 

 Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls. 

 But in recent weeks the government has made it clear that any actions perceived to imperil Communist Party rule will be defined as threats to national security _ and therefore outside the purview of the global treaty and other human rights conventions.
