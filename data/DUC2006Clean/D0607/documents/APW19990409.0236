BEIJING (AP) -- A shortage of tear gas and rubber bullets forced China's military to open fire 10 years ago on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, a former top Communist Party member said Friday. 

 Keeping to the party's official version of the controversial 1989 melee, Zhu Muzhi said troops were justified in firing on ``thugs'' who killed soldiers and threw rocks and gas bombs. But he acknowledged that ``innocent'' people were also killed in the crackdown on democracy advocates. 

 Zhu suggested that with better anti-riot equipment and more experience in dealing with civil unrest, the Chinese government might have avoided heavy loss of life. 

 ``We never imagined there would be such an incident, that so many thugs would surround and beat the People's Liberation Army,'' Zhu, then a member of an advisory commission of party elders, told reporters. ``The police at the time had no rubber bullets, no tear gas canisters, they had nothing. In the end, the only weapon they had at hand was guns.'' 

 In the assault, ``many people on the streets who were watching the goings-on possibly were hit by flying bullets. They, in fact, were innocent,'' said Zhu, who now heads a government-backed society for human rights studies. 

 Hundreds were killed when Chinese troops shot their way through Beijing on June 4, 1989, to quell seven weeks of peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reform. 

 The government said the protests were an anti-government rebellion that needed to be put down with force. It has never given a credible account of the number of dead and injured, or of the thousands imprisoned in the wave of arrests that followed. 

 With the 10th anniversary of the protest movement drawing near, Chinese authorities are particularly nervous about any attempts at public commemoration. 

 A witness to the crackdown disputed Zhu's claim that police lacked riot gear. Robin Munro, formerly with Human Rights Watch, said he saw Chinese police with riot shields, helmets and leather boots in Beijing after martial law was declared on May 20 -- 16 days before the military assault. 

 ``They had no justification in sending in the army. Period,'' he said. Zhu's claims are ``just an excuse to justify the unjustifiable.'' 

 Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, Zhu recalled seeing ``thugs'' chase a group of soldiers during the crackdown and throw one of them off a highway overpass. The crowd burned the body, he said. 

 The protests ``had evolved into the stage where the people wanted to overthrow the government,'' Zhu said. ``I understand why at last the PLA soldiers were forced to shoot.'' 

 Under further questioning, Zhu conceded that police did have ``a little'' tear gas at their disposal. 

 China has beefed up its riot and paramilitary police, particularly in Beijing, since the crackdown. 

 A decade of uninterrupted economic growth since 1989 proved the crackdown was correct, Zhu claimed. 

 ``If the handling of June 4 had been totally wrong then these past 10 years would have been difficult. China would definitely have been in total chaos,'' he said.
