BEIJING (AP) _ Several thousand taxi drivers angered by new government fees protested outside city offices, paralyzing part of a Chinese provincial capital for three days last week. All but a few hundred of Shijiazhuang's 4,000 taxi drivers walked off the job Wednesday night, and by 9 a.m. Thursday 1,000 striking cabbies had mobbed entrances and streets around the city government office, a human rights group said Sunday. Hundreds of police tried to get the protesters to stop blocking the streets, and the angry strikers attacked cabbies who did not join in the strike, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. A plan announced last month to stop issuing new taxi operating licenses and to raise registration fees in Shijiazhuang _ capital of Hebei province, 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Beijing _ provoked the strike, said the Information Center. Protests and sporadic attacks on strike-breakers continued until city officials agreed Saturday afternoon to put off the new policy, said the Information Center and an official in the Hebei propaganda office, who gave only his surname, Wang. While the Information Center reported that 3,000 taxi drivers went on strike, the official would say only that several thousand took part. He added that there were no arrests.
