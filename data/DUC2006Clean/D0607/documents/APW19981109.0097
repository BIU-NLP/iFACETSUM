BEIJING (AP) _ Workers from a state-run cement factory surrounded government offices in central China for five days to protest a plan to privatize their plant, a rights group reported Monday. All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New York-based Human Rights in China reported. About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang, in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group said. Confirming the demonstrations, an official in charge of economic planning for Luoyang said the protesters dispersed after the government pledged to look into the workers' concerns. No one was arrested or hurt, said the official with the city's Economic and Trade Commission, who only gave his surname, Pan. Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom. The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state sector. Local officials have been quick to sell the best state assets, in some cases steering them to cronies. Unrest among workers _ long used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has sharpened. Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions. They also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100 taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2 million) in assets. But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs 242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China said. Mr. Pan of the Luoyang Economic and Trade Commission said the sale will be put on hold until all concerns are settled.
