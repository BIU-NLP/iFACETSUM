BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here today that although deepening economic reform will cause certain pressure on employment, it will by no means touch off social unrest. 

 Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social unrest. 

 Li, who is also minister of labor, quoted the report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the congress as saying, "With the deepening of enterprise reforms, technological progress and readjustment of the economic structure, it would be hard to avoid the flow of personnel and lay-off." 

 "But no such 'disastrous outcome' as predicted by some overseas figures will go off," Li emphasized. 

 As far as Li was concerned, the employment situation in China faces both challenges and opportunities. 

 Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job opportunities. 

 The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment, he said. 

 Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in towns and cities. Many of them come from surplus factory worker forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million. 

 In addition, approximately 130 million peasants have become idle in the rural areas, and may compete with urbanites for jobs. 

 However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored great achievements. Each year from 1992 to 1996, the newly employed outnumbered the laid-offs by a margin of eight million, thus maintaining an annual unemployment rate in urban areas at about 3 percent throughout.
