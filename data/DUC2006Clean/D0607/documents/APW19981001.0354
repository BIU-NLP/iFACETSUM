BEIJING (AP) _ Threats by officials and a show of force by police forced farmers outside a south China provincial capital to abandon a planned protest Thursday, a rights group reported. Farmers outside Changsha city blocked construction of a science park last month after the well-connected developer was three months late in paying them for their land, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported. Authorities sent 700 regular and armed police to clear away the protesters in Tianmashan village on Sept. 22, and police arrested six farmers and beat more than 20, some severely, the Hong Kong-based group said. It gave the following account: When more than 300 villagers marched on the Hunan provincial government the following day, officials agreed to provide compensation. But the villagers were not satisfied, saying the rate was well below the market price, and they vowed to stage another protest Thursday, China's National Day. Local officials threatened the villagers against staging the protest, saying the government ``was not made of bean curd,'' the Hong Kong-based group said. An official with the city police department denied the report. ``Nothing like that happened in Changsha. It's a rumor,'' said the official, who gave only his surname, Li. China has been hit by hundreds of mostly small-scale protests over the past two years by farmers and workers upset over layoffs, government policies and perceived official indifference or corruption. The Information Center said one of those connected to the science park development was the brother-in-law of Wang Maolin, Hunan's Communist Party secretary.
