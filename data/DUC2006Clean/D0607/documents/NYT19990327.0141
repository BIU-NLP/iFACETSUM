BEIJING _ In late 1997, President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut the People's Liberation Army, then 3 million strong, by half a million troops as part of China's drive for a leaner, more advanced military that could both defend the homeland and reinforce China's image as a power in Asia. 

 What the president did not say was that as the army shrank, another, more secretive branch of the military, dedicated to internal stability, was already expanding. At the very time of Jiang's speech, it was absorbing 14 army divisions, or more than 100,000 troops. 

 The expansion of the People's Armed Police, a national force trained in riot control, reflects the leaders' growing preoccupation with domestic unrest. It also reflects their wish to avoid having to resort to army combat troops to quell popular demonstrations, as occurred in 1989 around Tiananmen Square with disastrously bloody results. 

 Over the last year, according to witnesses and other accounts, armed police units were called out to help the ordinary police contain many of the hundreds of demonstrations and protests reported around China. The armed police have also battled ethnic separatists in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang, and have long been used to help control Tibet. 

 The protests bubbling up around China, almost always centered on economic complaints, have generally been small, and dispersed peacefully. But with urban unemployment soaring and farmers restive over high taxes and corruption, Jiang has proclaimed domestic stability as this year's No. 1 priority. And he apparently looks to the force he has built up _ now 1 million strong, Western analysts say _ to keep any unrest from getting out of hand. 

 ``As a major force for maintaining state security and social stability, the People's Armed Police shoulders a massive and formidable burden,'' he said on a visit to an armed police barracks in Beijing last month. 

 Last year, two China experts from the U.S. military stated the force's purpose even more baldly. 

 ``By increasing the size of the People's Armed Police, the leadership in Beijing implicitly acknowledges that internal unrest is a greater threat to the regime's survival and Chinese economic modernization than is foreign invasion,'' said John F. Corbett Jr., an American officer, and Dennis J. Blasko, writing in China Strategic Review, a journal published in Washington. Corbett, who works in the Pentagon, and Blasko, now a consultant, both previously served as military attaches in Beijing. 

 Officers of the People's Armed Police, which was formed in the early 1980s from a combination of army and public security units, declined to be interviewed. 

 Like Western riot policemen, the People's Armed Police officers are supposed to control demonstrations with minimal violence _ preferably with intimidation, shields and sometimes tear gas, although they carry guns and have heavier weapons. 

 The expansion and upgrading of the force accelerated after 1989, when it may have numbered about 600,000. That year, the armed police's failure to disperse student demonstrators in Beijing forced the leaders to call in combat units, which killed hundreds of civilians and did lasting damage to China's image as well as to army morale. 

 Civilian police sometimes carry weapons too, but operate under command of the Public Security Ministry rather than the military, as most People's Armed Police units do. 

 The army has been only too happy to shed an unpopular mission for its regular forces. Freed from worry about crowd control, which requires entirely different skills and equipment, the People's Liberation Army ``can concentrate on becoming a modern, externally oriented force,'' said David Shambaugh, a China expert at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington. 

 The expansion of the armed police may also give Jiang, who had no military experience, an important personal base of power, outside experts believe. 

 Deployments of the armed police to quell unrest are rarely announced, but there is evidence that they have been in action numerous times around China in the past year. 

 State news media often portray the armed police in more benign roles _ like working alongside regular soldiers to pile sandbags during last summer's record floods. 

 But in January, 9,000 armed police were sent to help existing forces ranged against a violent separatist movement in the western province of Xinjiang. In rural Hunan in January, hundreds of armed police officers dispersed a crowd of many thousands of angry farmers by lobbing tear-gas grenades and charging with clubs, villagers said. One man was killed by an exploding gas grenade and dozens were injured. 

 Most demonstrations have ended peacefully. But Western analysts question whether the People's Armed Police would be up to its job in the event of large-scale unrest, particularly if the job of controlling it falls to the underequipped, poorly trained units deployed in areas far from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. 

 ``The question now is whether the People's Armed Police is up to the task,'' said a Western analyst who has closely studied the armed police, and spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Because of a limited budget and long-term quality and management problems, i's still debatable whether they can perform well in a major crisis.''
