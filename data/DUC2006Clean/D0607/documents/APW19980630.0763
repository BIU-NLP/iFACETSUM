BEIJING (AP) _ A thousand retirees from a nearly bankrupt state auto maker disrupted traffic in a central Chinese city Tuesday to protest a lack of pension payments, a human rights group reported. The protesters from Wuhan's Light Auto Works General factory blocked streets for 2 1/2 hours before city officials agreed to give them three months of overdue pension payments, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. Duty officers with city agencies, reached after hours by telephone, refused to confirm the demonstration. The protest was the sixth this month in the ailing industrial city and is part of a nationwide wave of unrest by workers as state factories cut jobs to cope with government-ordered market reforms. The Light Autoworks, like many state enterprises, suffered from bad management and bloated payrolls, the Information Center said.
