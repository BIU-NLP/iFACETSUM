BEIJING (AP) _ Police in a far west Chinese region rocked by a series of terrorist attacks have arrested a group of suspects and seized firearms, an official newspaper reported. The attacks occured in the Yili district of Xinjiang, a large, restive region where Muslim separatists are battling Chinese rule. Acts of violent terrorism have occured ``many times'' in Yili since last year, the Xinjiang Daily said in its Aug. 24 edition, seen Saturday in Beijing. Police responded with repeated efforts this year to suppress the terrorists, breaking up more than 10 criminal gangs, detaining a group of suspects and seizing guns and ammunition, the newspaper said. It gave no details of the crackdown but said some police officers were killed and injured. Since last year, Yili police have set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said. Xinjiang was ruled by Chinese emperors for 200 years as a buffer state between China and the Muslim nations of Central Asia. The Uighurs, Xinjiang's main ethnic group, briefly ran an independent state before communist forces retook the region in 1949. Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic revolution. China has tried to counter the effect by improving relations with Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and getting them to pledge not to support anti-Chinese separatists.
