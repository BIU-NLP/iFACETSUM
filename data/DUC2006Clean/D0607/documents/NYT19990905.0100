BEIJING _ The Chinese government on Sunday night announced sweeping increases in salaries, pensions and welfare payments for 84 million people, describing the move as a birthday gift as the country prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. 

 Officials clearly hope the raises will help their attack, as yet futile, on a stubborn case of deflation that is holding down economic growth. Insecure about their financial prospects, consumers are saving rather than spending and the retail price index has declined for some 22 months. 

 The pay increases, which are generally in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent and are retroactive to July 1, will go to workers and retirees in government offices, schools and other state-funded facilities. In addition, monthly subsidies to millions of unemployed workers and urban poor people will increase by an average of 30 percent, according to the announcement on national television news Sunday night. 

 As for beleaguered state-owned enterprises, the announcement said they must decide on wages ``according to their efficiency.'' 

 The announcement was not a surprise because officials have publicly said in recent weeks that a raise was in store. 

 The raise will cost the government more than $6 billion for the second half of this year, said the finance minister, Xiang Huicheng, in a television interview Sunday night. 

 The average increase for public workers will be only $15 a month, officials said. Many senior bureaucrats and college professors earn little more than $100 a month in cash salary, plus bonuses and other benefits. At the same time, many workers face rising rents as the government tries to reduce housing subsidies and create a commercial housing market. 

 Growth in the first half of this year is said to be 7.6 percent, just under last year's annual rate, but many experts say these figures are significantly overstated. Slowed growth and rising unemployment in the last two years have contributed to social unrest. 

 In another effort to goad people into spending more, the government said last week that it would begin taxing the interest earned on personal savings accounts. Many Chinese are not accustomed to paying income tax and that measure was greeted by much grumbling. 

 The government is also continuing to issue bonds for infrastructure projects, but as it runs out of options it may also have to consider devaluation of the yuan in the coming year to get the needed economic jolt, some foreign economists say. 

 In the interview Sunday night, Xiang, the finance minister, said he hoped that the raises would stimulate consumption and help to reduce the growing ``irregularities'' in salaries _ a reference to the huge gulf in compensation between middle- and upper-level civil servants and people in the growing private sector. 

 Asked whether the raises had been timed with the Oct. 1 anniversary in mind, Xiang replied, ``Yes, of course. The 50th anniversary is a time when all of China is celebrating.''
