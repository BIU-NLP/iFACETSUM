BEIJING (AP) -- Seven million Chinese workers will lose their jobs in state factories as China pushes ahead with reforms of the debt-ridden government-run industrial sector, a Chinese newspaper reported Tuesday. 

 Vice Minister of Labor and Social Security Wang Jianlun said the government would limit layoffs to 7 million, or 1 million people fewer than last year, the China Daily said. 

 In order to reform its state factories, China needs to lay off even more workers. Government leaders, however, have warned the layoffs must be restricted to prevent unrest. 

 The government expects to spend 24.5 billion yuan ($3 billion) to retrain and provide stipends for laid-off workers this year, Wang said. 

 Workers who lose jobs in China's state-owned factories get monthly allowances of 140 yuan to 380 yuan ($17 to $46) when they enroll at training centers, the report said. The allowances are paid by the government, an unemployment insurance fund and the state factories. 

 Wang acknowledged that some of the troubled factories had been failing to pay pensions. He said the government would ensure at least 50 percent of the pensions owed would be paid by the end of the year.
