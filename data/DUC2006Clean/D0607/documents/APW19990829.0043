BEIJING (AP) -- China will raise stipends to unemployed workers by 30 percent as part of a series of measures intended to arrest the economic slide and brighten public sentiment ahead of the country's 50th anniversary of communist rule. 

 Labor and Social Security Minister Zhang Zuoji promised that increased payments would begin before the Oct. 1 anniversary. 

 Pensions are also to be raised by varying degrees, Zhang told the executive committee of China's legislature, according to state media. 

 The announcements were made as Beijing prepared its second large-scale rehearsal of the planned Oct. 1 parade and performance by a half-million people on Tiananmen Square. Police closed off streets leading to the square late Saturday, and buses brought in students and others for the practice session. 

 Unemployment has soared as once centrally planned industries trim bloated payrolls to cope with free-market reforms. With millions of Chinese trying to survive on meager stipends, the communist leadership has worried about the potential for unrest. 

 Zhang told the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that more than 7.4 million urban workers lost their jobs in the first half of the year, and 5.4 million of them have not found new work. 

 Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, unaffected by interest rate cuts that have failed to ignite consumer spending. 

 Before the welfare increases, the average jobless worker received a $20 stipend and another $10 for life, medical and unemployment insurance, the Xinhua News Agency reported. 

 But Zhang said 300,000 workers laid off this year never received their stipends. He noted that many local governments had been unable to collect sufficient revenues to cover the payments. 

 The government also has announced a 30 to 40 percent pay increase for civil servants, and halved a tax on fixed-asset investments.
