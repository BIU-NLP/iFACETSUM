BEIJING (AP) _ Five hundred state factory workers, unpaid for four months, broke a police line Monday and marched in protest through an impoverished southwestern Chinese city, a rights group reported. The workers demanded back pay and shouted slogans decrying waste and corruption by state factory managers as they marched through Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Officials with the Chengdu city government, which oversees Dujiangyan, confirmed the protest but refused to provide details. The Information Center gave the following account: At 11:30 a.m., 500 workers from the Min River Timber Machinery Factory gathered near a bridge in the city's center and began to march. Dozens of police tried to block them from a main thoroughfare. But the angry demonstrators pushed through and police did not try to use force to stop them. Two trends converged in sparking the unrest, the third demonstration by angry workers in Dujiangyan in 13 months. The city, a famous scenic spot in Sichuan's western foothills, 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Chengdu, is home to many bankrupt state industries. Throughout China, hundreds of protests have erupted as uncompetitive state industries founder on capitalist market reforms. In the case of Min River Timber, the money-losing venture was serving a logging industry in severe decline after decades of unrestrained clear-cutting of forests. Last week, the government imposed a ban on logging in western Sichuan to stop the environmental damage that compounded disastrous flooding this summer. Workers from the 2,000-employee Min River Timber appealed many times to the Dujiangyan government about their owed wages, but never received a reply, the Information Center said.
