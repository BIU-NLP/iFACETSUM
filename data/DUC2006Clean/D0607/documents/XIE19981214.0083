 on April 15, Hu Yaobang passed away. Various mourning activities were held by people and students. But, a small number of people took advantage of this to spread rumors, attacking the Party and state leaders, inciting the people to oppose the leadership of the Party and the socialist system. 

 The People's Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee, carried an editorial saying that there must be a clear-cut stand against unrest on April 26. That unrest developed into turmoil because of the support and connivance of Zhao Ziyang. The so-called "Federation of Autonomous Student Unions", an illegal student organization, urged its supporters to stage a hunger strike in Tian'anmen Square beginning on May 13. 

 The State Council decided to declare a martial law in parts of Beijing starting from May 20. However, the organizers of the unrest and those scheming in the background took advantage of the restraints of the government and troops, and went about organizing various illegal activities which led to a counter revolutionary rebellion. The State Council repealed martial law conditions on parts of Beijing on January 11, 1990. 

 On May 16, 1989, Sino-Soviet relations were normalized according to an announcement made by Deng Xiaoping during his meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the then president of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the then general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
