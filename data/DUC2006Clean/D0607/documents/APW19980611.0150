BEIJING (AP) _ China's villages must be run more openly and democratically, top government and Communist Party leaders say in a new order sent to rural communities, state media reported Thursday. The circular says village leaders can no longer make decisions in secret about spending public money for development projects, leasing out farm land, birth control and distribution of relief funds. Democratic and open village government is needed to improve relations between the ruling Communist party and the people and to promote rural development and stability, according to the new order, which was issued by the party's policy-making Central Committee and the State Council, the highest government body. China has had a national law establishing elections at the village level since 1987. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has promoted secret ballots, candidate speeches and fair election procedures throughout the country. But the new order suggested that elections alone have not guaranteed that villages run their affairs democratically or have been able to rid themselves of local bullies. It also showed that the central government wants to ensure that the countryside does not erupt in unrest. The order was played prominently on the front page of the People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party. Rural people, who make up 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion people, are the Communist Party's ``reliable force'' and ``the broadest and deepest mass base for political power in our country,'' the government's order said. It called for several specific improvements in how China's 1 million villages are run. Each village must post a report about village affairs at least every three months. Villagers also are supposed to keep tabs on their leaders by forming congresses of all village residents or representatives. Leaders should make decisions based on the majority's views, the order says. Officials also are ordered to make public their own salaries and performance reviews. The order also warns that vote buying is illegal. ``Malpractice by a few officials acting willfully regardless of the villagers' wishes must be corrected resolutely,'' it said.
