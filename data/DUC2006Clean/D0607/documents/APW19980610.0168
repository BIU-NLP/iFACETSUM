BEIJING (AP) _ Several hundred disgruntled residents staged protests Wednesday in Xi'an, the Chinese city famed for its terracotta warriors that will be President Clinton's first stop in China later this month, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights group. The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different grievances against the government began Tuesday morning. A group of about 150 people were protesting the government's failure to allocate them new housing after they were evicted from their homes for redevelopment, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow them to work as taxi drivers, the group said. Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood. Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at about 6 p.m. Tuesday. They resumed their protest Wednesday morning, the human rights center said. Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles. Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests in recent months. The Hong Kong-based group reported last week that police in Xi'an had beaten one of the thousands of onlookers watching a sit-in on June 2 by 200 workers from the No. 1 Construction Co. who were protesting layoffs. The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to lay off millions of workers. In cities throughout China, many of the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make ends meet. In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair. &UR; (ek)
