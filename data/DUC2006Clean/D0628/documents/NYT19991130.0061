 MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ There's no point in getting angry about taxes. Maybe it's emotionally satisfying, but it won't do any good. What will help is focusing on things we can control. When it comes to taxes, that means finding ways to make the tax laws work for us. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED. 

 LIFESTYLE 

 ADULT-ADHD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ADHD has only within the last few years been recognized as a legitimate adult diagnosis. ``A lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said Dr. Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. ``We now know that's not true. Somewhere between 15-20 percent may outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that impair them markedly as adults.'' (Susman, Palm Beach Post). MOVED. 

 AIDS-TEEN _ ATLANTA _ 15-year-old Dylan Edwards doesn't have HIV, but he is just as much a casualty of the AIDS epidemic as those who are infected with the virus. Dylan's life has been dominated by AIDS since he was 3 years old, when both of his parents and his younger brother were found to be HIV-positive. His father died of AIDS 9 years ago; his 12-year-old brother Chris died last month. Aside from a serious bout with shingles in 1994, his mother has been healthy _ but she's not on any AIDS drugs right now. Dylan has grown up in the shadow of his brother's illness. He starred on the freshman football team this season, but no one from his family came to the games _ his mom was at Scottish Rite Hospital with Chris. Dylan is a bright, well-spoken boy, but does poorly in school and seethes with barely concealed anger and frustration. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 45. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED. 

 PETS-WORK _ If she's not sacked out on a desk somewhere or sprinting up the stairs after an officemate, look for Scarlett begging a bit of barbecue from a coworker who's just come back from the restaurant down the street. It may not be what you'd consider proper office etiquette, but as long as she's not piddling on the carpet or barging uninvited into staff meetings, Scarlett and others like her are welcome at a growing number of Austin companies that allow employees to bring dogs to work. (LeBlanc, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS. MOVED. 

 HOME AND GARDEN 

 GARDENS-SEA _ On its surface, Gardens By The Sea, written and published by the Garden Club of Palm Beach, would seem to have a fairly limited audience. The introduction, written by local horticulturist Gene Joyner, calls it ``an in-depth how-to book on the trials and successes of gardening on oceanfront and near oceanfront property.'' (Palm Beach Post).MOVED. 

 GARDENING-LIFE _ MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Lee May conducts his first ``burn'' in Fightingtown Creek. The mission: get rid of as much of the myriad of suckering sourwood stumps, briar thickets and scraggly pines as possible. The mountain folks know ``it makes a lot more sense to burn this stuff in place than to try hauling it away.'' So, he lit up a pile and after it was safely burned out, he lit the next. Until all piles were gone. ``My first burn.'' (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO.

 ROSES _ DALTON,Ga. _ Sam Pullen of Dalton knows roses. He knows them so well in fact that he's still able to gather several dozens a day even though it's December. What's his secret? ``The more you pick them, the more they bloom,'' Sam says, ``It takes a lot out of the rose bush if you don't cut them often.'' During peak season in June, Sam has picked as many as 30 dozen in one day from his 750 hybrid tea and floribunda bushes. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)WITH PHOTOS.
