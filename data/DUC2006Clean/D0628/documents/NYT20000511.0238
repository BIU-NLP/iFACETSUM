BERNE, N.Y. _ Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. 

 And like thousands of parents, Michael and Jill Carroll worry about the drug's side effects, including sleeplessness and loss of appetite. But they keep their child on the medication, in part because they fear child welfare workers will take him away if they don't. 

 Earlier this year, administrators from the school district called Albany County Child Protective Services, alleging child abuse when the Carrolls said they wanted to take Kyle off the drug. 

 As a result, the Carrolls are now on a statewide list of alleged child abusers, and they have been thrust into an Orwellian family court battle to clear their name and to ensure their child isn't removed from their home. 

 ``It's beyond the point of whether he should be on it. Now it's the point of them telling us what we're going to do,'' said Michael Carroll. ``They're telling me how to raise my child.'' 

 The Carroll's dilemma is not unique. While there are no reliable statistics on the phenomenon, observers say public schools are increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a stimulant being prescribed to an increasing number of students. 

 According to a recent report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, as many as 3.8 million school children, mostly boys, have ADHD. The disorder is characterized by a short attention span, jumpiness and impulsive behavior. But many cases are misdiagnosed, the study found. Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years. 

 Along with that increase, schools are using some heavy-handed tactics on parents who may balk at the medication. 

 ``The schools are now using child protective services to enforce their own desires and their own policies,'' said David Lansner, a New York City lawyer who has seen cases similar to the Carrolls'. 

 ``This thing is so scary,'' remarked Patricia Weathers, of Millbrook, N.Y., a suburb of Poughkeepsie. Officials at the Millbrook school district called police and child protective services when she took her 9-year-old son, Michael Mozer, off medications earlier this year. She said a drug cocktail including Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate. ``My son was a guinea pig,'' said Weathers, who now sends the child to a private school. 

 ``This is relatively new but it's happening,'' said Peter Breggin, a Bethesda, Md., psychiatrist, of the school districts' legal tactics. Breggin opposes the use of Ritalin. 

 Albany's child protective services didn't return phone calls seeking comment. 

 ``We feel we are unable to give our side of the story due to confidentiality,'' said Steven Schrade, the school district superintendent here. 

 Schrade noted that schools do not prescribe medication such as Ritalin. Any drug prescription has to come from a physician, although school nurses can administer the drug and school officials can recommend it. 

 Kyle Carroll started taking Ritalin last year, after he fell behind in his schoolwork. 

 Teachers drew up an Individualized Education Plan, a standard course of action for children with special needs, and they started giving him speech therapy and extra reading help. He also went to summer school. 

 But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin and extra help didn't seem to do much good. The Carrolls grew concerned when Kyle was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating just one meal a day. So they told school officials they wanted to take Kyle off Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped. 

 That's when they got a call, then a visit, from a Child Protective Services worker. 

 The visit led to a family court appearance in April, which was continued to later this month. The hearing will give the Carrolls a chance to clear their name _ to some extent. If cleared, their case in the state register of alleged abusers will be sealed, but it could be opened in the future if there are other allegations of abuse. 

 Jill Carroll is particularly concerned because she's training to become a childcare worker. Being in the state register could keep her from working in that field. 

 Moreover, the Carrolls still don't know all the details of the charges against them. The ``intake report'' on their case states that ``Fa (father) is refusing to give the ch (child) the Ritalin.'' 

 But several lines on the report are blacked out with a marking pen. It's roughly analogous to a criminal facing charges but not being told what they are. Complaints to Child Protective Services are also anonymous, so suspects don't know who has leveled the charges. In this case, however, the Carrolls say they were told that a school guidance counselor made the complaint. 

 Michael Carroll noted this wasn't his first brush with Child Protective Services. Last year, he said, a social worker checked on an anonymous rumor that he had gotten drunk and struck family members, but the allegations turned out to be groundless. No charges were filed, and the Carrolls were not ``indicated,'' or written up in the state register like they were for the Ritalin episode. 

 Since meeting with the services' workers this year, the Carrolls have taken their boy to another pediatrician for a second opinion. The doctor recommended staying with the Ritalin, and the Carrolls have reluctantly agreed. 

 ``He's in school. He's on the Ritalin. He dislikes school very much,'' Michael Carroll said.
