SAN ANTONIO _ A study directed by a physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center has concluded that a drug called Adderall might be a better choice for some hyperactive children than the more widely prescribed Ritalin. 

 Most of the children in the study took only a single dose of Adderall daily, and researchers said its overall performance was better than methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin. 

 Dr. Steven Pliszka, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center, was the lead investigator in the study published this month in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Funding for the research came from Shire Richwood Inc., a subsidiary of Adderall manufacturer Shire Pharmaceuticals. 

 An estimated 2 million children in the United States have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and hyperactivity. Stimulant-based medication long has been the primary treatment for the disorder, and methylphenidate has accounted for 80 percent of the prescriptions written during the past decade. 

 Adderall, a mixture of two types of amphetamines, initially was developed as a weight loss drug in the 1960s and later fell out of use. The manufacturer revived it several years ago after tests showed it was effective in treating ADHD. It has been used largely for children who don't respond to methylphenidate. 

 Pliszka's study is part of an effort by doctors to compare the two drugs in controlled tests. 

 ``It shows that we can use Adderall first,'' Pliszka said. ``Physicians and families should feel very comfortable about using it. That's the main finding of this study.'' 

 The study involved 58 children who got Adderall, methylphenidate or a placebo _ a harmless, unmedicated preparation _ for three weeks. During that time, the children were evaluated periodically by teachers and parents, using a scale that assessed whether their behavior and attention problems were improving. 

 Pliszka said the research showed both medications were superior to the placebo and that Adderall performed better than methylphenidate. Seventy percent of the children on Adderall also were able to get by on one dose a day, eliminating the need for midday medication, Pliszka said. 

 That finding could be an important point for Shire, because new drugs are entering the marketplace that are designed for once-a-day dosing. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is seeking federal approval for its new drug, Concerta, which will offer single-dose convenience. The company expects to begin marketing the drug later this year.

 Ritalin is manufactured by CIBA-Geigy Corp.
