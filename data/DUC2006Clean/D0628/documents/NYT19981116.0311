WASHINGTON _ When a little green pill turns a miserable, rowdy, troublemaking kid into an attentive, quiet and apparently happy youngster, it is either correcting an imbalance of brain chemistry or suppressing the child's natural spontaneity and innovative impulses. 

 It depends on who's describing it. 

 But sales of the pill, the stimulant methylphenidate, which is marketed under the trade name Ritalin, have more than doubled in the past decade as more and more parents, teachers and therapists turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

 While the drug, which acts on the brain in much the same way as cocaine, is increasingly used to make better students out of elementary school children deemed to have ``developmental disorders,'' a growing number of specialists has begun to question the wisdom of using the drug. 

 In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent. 

 A committee of psychiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians, pharmacologists and educators will listen to experts on different sides of the controversy before attempting Wednesday to issue a ``consensus statement'' on ADHD and its treatment. 

 The panel, assembled by the National Institutes of Health, heard its first presentations Monday. 

 ``We are taking away their vitality with psychostimulants that can cause irreversible brain damage,'' Dr. Peter Breggin, a Maryland psychiatrist, told the panel Monday. 

 But referring to findings from sophisticated brain-imaging equipment, other experts insisted people with ADHD suffer from identifiable brain disorders. 

 Certain areas appear to be smaller than normal and are less active during mental tests. Theories about the cause range from genetics to injuries suffered during fetal development. 

 For such conditions and the chemical imbalances that develop because of them, some experts said, methylphenidate is the best treatment currently available. 

 People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed as having ADHD _ impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine, according to this view. 

 Like cocaine, methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain. 

 In effect, it increases the time the reduced number of receptors is exposed to dopamine. 

 But that may not be as simple as it sounds. 

 For one thing, while ADHD has been thought of as a temporary condition that children ``grow out of,'' recent findings suggest it may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime. 

 And while the Food and Drug Administration has approved the sale of methylphenidate on the basis of short-term studies of its safety and effectiveness, no one knows the impact of long-range use of the drug. 

 ``Between 1990 and 1995, there was a 2 1/2-fold increase in sales of methylphenidate,'' said Andrew Rowland, a researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ``We need to generate long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of this drug.'' 

 After listening to other researchers Tuesday morning, the panel is to discuss the ADHD-drug issue privately in the afternoon and issue a consensus panel Wednesday. 

 Specific questions the consensus committee is charged with answering include: 

 _ Whether ADHD is, in fact, a disorder. 

 _ What impact it has on individuals, families and society. 

 _ What are the effective treatments? 

 _ What are their risks? 

 _ What directions should future research take?
