WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission charged a New York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders. 

 Natural Organics Inc., of Melville, N.Y., claims in advertising that its Pedi-Active A.D.D. supplement can alleviate symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and improve the attention span of children who have difficulty focusing on schoolwork, the FTC said in a statement. 

 ''ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned about it should talk to their children's doctors about appropriate treatment,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. She asserted that the company's ads prey on parents seeking alternative treatments. 

 Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the United States. 

 Natural Organics did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

 The company, which does business as ''Nature's Plus,'' markets and sells a variety of dietary supplements through independent retail stores. Sixty tablets of Pedi-Active A.D.D. sell for $12.56. 

 This is the FTC's fifth action involving products marketed to treat ADHD. While the commission's complaint begins a legal process seeking to stop future unsupported claims, it doesn't mean any laws have been broken.
