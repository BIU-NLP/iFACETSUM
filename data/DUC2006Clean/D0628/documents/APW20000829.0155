BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A psychologist says he and a partner in Tennessee may be on to a biological test for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 

 Vincent J. Monastra of the FBI Attention Disorders Clinic in the suburb of Endicott and Joel F. Lubar of the University of Tennessee say the disorder can be diagnosed by monitoring activity in the front region of the brain. They have developed a test they say is 90 percent effective. 

 If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it would be the first laboratory procedure for diagnosing ADHD. 

 ADHD is currently diagnosed according to a set of guidelines written by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
