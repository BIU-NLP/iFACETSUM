WASHINGTON _ Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. 

 The test suggests that parents of children suspected of having the learning and behavioral problem may someday be able to have their children tested before deciding whether to have them take potent and controversial drugs such as Ritalin and other stimulants. 

 But Bertha Madras, one of the Harvard Medical School researchers who performed the initial test, said many more experiments must be performed before such a test is available. 

 ``The initial data is robust,'' she said Thursday in a telephone interview, ``but a cascade of experiments have to be done before we can say we have a diagnostic tool.'' 

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5 percent of children in the United States. In general, it affects such functions as working memory, self-control and motivation. 

 Madras, a professor of biopsychology at the medical school, said the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter. 

 By linking a radioactive iodine molecule to a substance that locks onto the dopamine transporter, the researchers were able to use imaging instruments to directly measure the concentrations of transporter. 

 The study is described in a report being published Friday in the British medical journal, the Lancet. 

 The finding appears to confirm theories about the way ADHD affects its victims, but Madras said tests on larger populations of adults and later on children must be performed. 

 The researchers have applied for Food and Drug Administration approval for a second test with a larger group of adults, she said.

 Psychologists and psychiatrists say the condition seems to affect girls and boys differently. 

 Most girls with ADHD have a form known as Type A, which is characterized primarily by inattentiveness and distractibility, and less by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. 

 The most common form among boys is known as Type B. Rather than flightiness, persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and impulsive. 

 A Type C involves symptoms of both Types A and B. And Type D patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life, but none that clearly fit the other three forms. 

 Studies have shown that academic performance of 90 percent of the school-age patients improves with stimulant medication, principally the drug methylphenidate, marketed as Ritalin. 

 However, the treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is addictive to test animals. 

 It also is one of the most commonly diverted and stolen substances in America, and more high school students are reported to abuse it than receive it under prescription. 

 Moreover, the diagnosis of ADHD is based on behavioral studies and can involve often-subjective judgements on the part of therapists. 

 A consensus development panel convened last year by the National Institutes of Health recommended continued use of stimulant drugs for ADHD, but also called for more research toward understanding the nature of the disease and developing a more precise diagnostic procedures. 

 Although the chemical reasons for ADHD are not clearly understood, scientists have speculated that the brain's failure to control the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays signals between nerve cells, is involved. 

 Specifically, some researchers believe the transporter protein _ the ``truck'' that moves dopamine from one cell to the next _ is key to the condition. 

 Normally, the transporter protein gathers up the dopamine after it has stimulated its target cells and returns it to the cells that released it. 

 Methyphenidate, cocaine and other stimulant drugs are known to inhibit the transporter protein. By taking the ``trucks'' off the highway, the drugs cause dopamine to build up and continue to stimulate its targeted nerve cells, Madras explained. 

 This has the paradoxical effect of calming persons with ADHD. Some researchers think this is because their condition stems from a deficiency of target cells or of the cell receptors that react with dopamine.
