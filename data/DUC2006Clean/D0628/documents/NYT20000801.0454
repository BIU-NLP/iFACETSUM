SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a one-a-day pill for attention-deficit disorder that is easier to take and possibly more effective than current three-a-day versions of the commonly prescribed drug Ritalin. 

 The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View, Calif.'s Alza Corp., which can now enter the $700 million-a-year market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. 

 ADHD makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly. 

 ``This is the time of year when parents are making the decision to use or not use ADHD medications,'' said Alza chief executive Dr. Ernest Mario. 

 Mario said the company will immediately start promoting its one-a-day capsule to pediatricians. He said Alza could ship the first pills out of its Vacaville factory ``in a matter of days.'' 

 The Alza pill is based on the drug methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin, which has been used since the 1950s to control ADHD. 

 For the 3 to 5 percent of schoolchildren, mainly boys, who are believed to have ADHD, pediatricians routinely prescribe Ritalin or generic alternatives two or three times a day, generally around mealtimes. 

 Although Novartis, the Swiss drug firm that invented Ritalin, brought out a sustained-release version in 1984, that single-dose pill has not been widely used by physicians. Dr. Ami Goodman, a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, said doctors typically prescribe the multiple-dose versions because they think they work better. 

 Goodman said doctors have been hoping for an effective one-a-day version because fewer children will forget to take the drug. He said a one-a-day pill would remove the stigma that attaches to kids who must slip off to the school nurse's office for a noon booster. 

 ``It's a matter of trying to keep ADHD a more private affair,'' said Goodman, who had no opinion about whether the new Alza formula would be any more effective than Novartis' little-used sustained-release pill. 

 But Dr. Glen Elliot, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco and an Alza consultant, said the clinical studies leading up to the FDA's approval suggest that Alza has found the time-release technology that works. 

 Alza's secret is the pill itself, which is about the size of a Tic Tac candy. The pill's outer coating is actually a dose of the drug, which dissolves quickly and begins circulating through the child's bloodstream when the pill is taken before or after breakfast. 

 But it is what is inside the pill that counts. The outer shell dissolves to reveal a tiny plastic pump filled with a 12-hour dose. The pump works by osmosis. It absorbs water from the body. The water liquifies tiny amounts of drug and pushes the liquified drug out a microscopic hole in the pump at a rate calculated to exhaust the medicine just as the child is finishing homework. 

 The availability of an easy-to-use pill is sure to fuel the debate about whether ADHD is overdiagnosed _ and whether Ritalin or its generic alternatives are overprescribed. 

 Stephen Hinshaw, a psychiatrist at the University of California at Berkeley and an ADHD specialist, was part of a recent National Institutes of Health study that endorsed the effectiveness of Ritalin for controlling ADHD. 

 But, said Hinshaw, who is also an Alza consultant, the problem is that ADHD can be misdiagnosed in two ways: labeling boys with the condition simply because they are rambunctious, while missing girls who may have a form of ADHD that shortens their attention span without making them unruly in class. 

 ``The problem is that you can't evaluate ADHD in 10 minutes, but in some places that's all the time you get with your physician,'' Hinshaw said.
