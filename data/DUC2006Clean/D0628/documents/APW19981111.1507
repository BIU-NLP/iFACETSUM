SAN DIEGO (AP) _ About a million miles (kilometers) away and fixed in a spot where the Earth and the sun's gravitational tug is balanced, a satellite will study how much energy Earth absorbs from sunlight and how that affects the climate. Francisco P.J. Valero, a scientist from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, will lead the new NASA program. It uses a satellite in a fixed location _ known as L1 _ that will allow it to have a continuous view of Earth in sunlight. The satellite ``Triana,'' named after the sailor on Columbus' ship who spotted the ``New World,'' will be launched in 2000 aboard a space shuttle. Scientists plan for Triana to be the first satellite at the L1 point dedicated to observing Earth. Another satellite is now there observing activity of the sun. Valero, who works in Scripps' Atmospheric Research Laboratory, was selected over eight others to lead the research. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland will develop and manage the mission. &UR; ___ &UR; Study shows Ritalin is effective in helping children with ADHD ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Behavior in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder improves dramatically when they take the controversial drug Ritalin, according to a study. The study's early findings showed that the children who took the drug improved far more than children who were treated with only therapy. It should quiet some of the criticism of drugs such as Ritalin and encourage doctors to stop blaming ``bad parents'' and teachers, said Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the authors. The authors, from six medical centers including the University of California, Irvine, presented their preliminary results recently at the American College of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meeting in Anaheim. They believe it is the largest study of the disorder. ADHD affects 3 percent to 9 percent of all children, limiting their ability to focus, and accounts for one-third to one-half of referrals for mental health services for kids. Critics say doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children. But Jensen said the problem is that thousands of children aren't treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have not been diagnosed. The 600 children in the study, ages 7 to 9, were randomly placed in one of four groups: medication; psychosocial (behavior-modification therapy, social-skill building and summer programs); combination medication and psychosocial; and referral back to the community doctor. After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder. For social skills, however, combined treatment was best. &UR; ___ &UR; Concussions dangerous, hard to define WASHINGTON (AP) _ Concussions are the hidden dangers of contact sports. There are 82,000 brain injuries a year reported in sports, according to the American Academy of Neurology. In football alone, a brain injury occurs once in every 3.5 games, it said. What happens inside the skull after a hard hit is difficult to diagnose, even if the player is willing to report it _ which the player sometimes is not. Doctors are struggling to find a way to tell those players who can go back in the game from those who must wait and those who will never play again. ``A lot of times, we don't recognize it because the player does not want to tell us they have suffered a concussion,'' said Dr. Bryan Smith, head team physician at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ``There's a long tradition in college and high school where players accept injury as part of the risk of playing,'' said sports agent Leigh Steinberg of Newport Beach, California. ``Tough players are stoic and don't talk a lot about injury or pain. You have a fair amount of denial going on.'' The brain is the most complex organ in the body, Smith said. ``Even though we have certain symptoms and signs, they are quite variable and they don't always occur in each person that's been concussed.'' Some immediate symptoms are clear. A player may be dazed, dizzy, have trouble focusing attention or remembering, and even black out. Long-term damage can range from no effect to a loss of coordination or thinking ability to death.
