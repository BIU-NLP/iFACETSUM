Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US schoolchildren, scientists say.. 

 It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for ADHD, say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. 

 Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD. 

 In addition, it could reveal whether there are different forms of ADHD that respond better or worse to specific drugs. 

 ``It is an interesting, promising, beginning,'' said Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist and author of ``Driven to Distraction,'' a book about ADHD. He was not involved in the study. A test would be welcome, he said, ``because now it's based on the person's history and psychological testing, so there's an element of ambiguity'' about the diagnosis. 

 People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible, unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in school, social life and careers. 

 Previously suspected causes such as family surroundings, diet and allergies have largely been discarded as mounting evidence implicates brain abnormalities probably due to altered genes, said Russell A. Barkley, an ADHD researcher in the psychology and psychiatry departments of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. 

 The brain scanning experiment found a chemical imbalance, which had been previously suspected, in a part of the brain that uses the nerve messenger dopamine. Dopamine helps regulate attention and inhibits impulsive behavior. 

 Six adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD with standard tests had on average 70 percent more of a protein called the dopamine transporter than did a group of 30 normal volunteers, said the researchers. ``I think it's very exciting,'' said Dr. Thomas Spencer, an MGH researcher and an author of the study. ``It was stunning that a problem in their brain corresponded to their symptoms'' in all six ADHD patients. 

 A report on the study will be published Saturday as a letter in the British journal Lancet. In the brief article, the Massachusetts researchers described injecting patients with a radioactively tagged chemical agent called Altropane, which accumulated in dramatically higher levels in a particular part of the dopamine system in the brains of the ADHD patients. 

 The disorder varies a great deal among people, so the new method will have to prove itself able to diagnose a wide range of ADHD types, and also needs confirmation in children, the researchers cautioned. 

 ``This is certainly not yet a diagnostic test'' because it involved a ``very refined sample'' of ADHD patients who aren't representative of the entire spectrum of those who have it, said Barkley. 

 But if confirmed, he added, the test could help answer skeptics who question whether ADHD is a real disorder, and not just a poorly defined label placed on very active, normally rebellious chldren. Barkley noted, though, that gene tests for ADHD may arrive at the same time or even more quickly than the scanning test. 

 Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was supported by Boston Life Sciences, Inc., which says it intends to develop Altropane as an ADHD test. It has already made a test using Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease, the degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities. 

 Altropane, said Dr. Alan J. Fischman, an MGH nuclear medicine specialist and senior author of the study, is a synthetic analogue of cocaine. Its molecules bind very tightly to molecules in the brain known as dopamine transporters, which regulate the amount of dopamine in certain parts of the brain. (People injected with Altropane for the imaging tests don't feel any cocaine-like effects because the amount is so small, Fischman said.) 

 Altropane was designed by Bertha K. Madras of Harvard's New England Regional Primate Center in Southboro, Mass., who first had the idea of measuring the dopamine transporter in Parkinson disease and ADHD. 

 ``The idea came from a study I had done in the 1980s showing that Ritalin targets the dopamine transporter'' and binds to it tightly, said Madras. She suggested that the dopamine transporter might be a key player in ADHD, and if so, measuring the amount of the molecules could serve as a test. 

 After showing that Altropane homed in on different dopamine structures in Parkinson disease and was developed as a test for it, the researchers, in an alliance with Boston Life Sciences, turned to ADHD. 

 The experimental test required the volunteers to have Altropane injected intravenously. As it flowed through the brain, Altropane accumulated in the dopamine transporter molecules of the patients with ADHD and the difference between them and the normal patients was detected with an instrument known as a SPECT scanner. It took 30 to 45 minutes for the instrument to make the measurement. 

 The researchers are in the process of designing larger studies, probably involving hundreds of patients, to determine how reliable and accurate the method will prove to be. Testing the Altropane technique on children can come only after ethics review boards are convinced that it is safe, said the scientists.
