Experts estimate that 1.5 million to 2.4 million (or 3 percent to 5 percent) of schoolchildren in the United States have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. And tens of thousands are regularly given drugs like Ritalin to combat it. But in Britain the diagnosis is made for fewer than 1 percent of the schoolchildren. 

 Ken Jacobson, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, decided to investigate why. He says he believes his is the first cross-cultural study of the disorder. His findings are sure to contribute to debate over whether attention deficit disorder is the result of biology, as most experts now believe, or the creation of a society addicted to speed. 

 Examining 10- and 11-year-olds in Oxfordshire and in western Massachusetts, Jacobson found that there was little difference between the behavior of children in whom the disorder is diagnosed and those found to be normal. Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting. 

 ``The default condition that children will revert to is ADHD,'' Jacobson concluded. Though he holds master's degrees in neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain or abnormal glucose metabolism. 

 ``If you are inclined to diagnose a child as ADHD,'' he said, ``you have ample opportunity. And if you are inclined not to diagnose a child, you also have ample opportunity.'' 

 The difficulty of identifying the disorder has been recognized for years. In 1998 a panel of experts commissioned by the National Institutes of Health found that a consistent diagnostic method for the disorder had proved elusive. In December, a landmark study by the national institutes on treatment of the disorder found that the drug Ritalin was more effective than behavioral-modification therapy, which is what is primarily used in Britain. 

 Some people might use Jacobson's preliminary findings, which he presented at the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New Mexico in September and again at the American Anthropological Association in Chicago in November, to conclude that the disorder is simply widely underdiagnosed in Britain. 

 Jacobson recognizes this and says he has to do more work on why the British rate is so low. But he is convinced by his study, which should be completed in the spring, that the direct connection made between attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities is false. 

 ``I think something else is the cause of the problem that kids don't learn up to level that they are being compared to,'' he said. ``All children have talents, and all children have needs. What we are doing by focusing on ADHD is focusing on a few kids' needs. So we have a whole group of kids who have special needs and are not getting attention.''
