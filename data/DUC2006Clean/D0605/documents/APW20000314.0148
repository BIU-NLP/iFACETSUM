CHICAGO (AP) -- Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure arthritis but might improve its symptoms with fewer side effects than traditional treatments, an analysis of 15 studies concludes. 

 But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints, according to the analysis in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 

 The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis, the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million people nationwide. They are sold over the counter in health food stores and became popular after being recommended in a 1997 book, ''The Arthritis Cure.'' 

 ''Overall, it seems probable that these compounds do have some efficacy in treating osteoarthritis symptoms and that they are safe,'' the authors wrote. 

 Dr. Timothy McAlindon, a Boston University rheumatologist and lead author of the analysis, said his conclusions are ''a little more positive'' than the ''profound skepticism which has existed.'' 

 ''I'm not actively recommending'' chondroitin and glucosamine, ''but I certainly don't discourage people from trying them provided they're cognizant of the available data,'' McAlindon said. 

 Both supplements are synthetic versions of body substances that help build cartilage, the tough tissue that lines the joints. Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage growth, though whether they do in humans remains to be seen, McAlindon said. The studies he analyzed compared the supplements with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring any changes in joints. 

 The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999. All involved patients with arthritis in the hip or knee. 

 Overall, the studies showed moderate to large benefits from the supplements. Chondroitin seemed to be the most effective. 

 But studies showing the biggest benefits were also the most flawed, McAlindon said. 

 Many failed to detail how the authors hid the identity of substances given to subjects -- a crucial element in placebo-controlled studies. 

 ''We also found evidence of publication bias,'' McAlindon said, referring to selective publication of the most positive results. 

 Most, if not all, of the studies were sponsored in some way by the supplements' makers. 

 While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments -- aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant side effects. 

 The analysis is ''an important contribution'' because the authors deciphered hard-to-interpret studies and provide a useful assessment of the latest research, said Dr. John Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation. 

 The analysis was funded by the National Institutes of Health.
