Pain sufferers may be getting some new drug options that appear to bring relief with fewer side effects than most other treatments. 

 One drug, called gabapentin, is already on the market as a treatment for epileptic seizures. Two new studies, appearing Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show the drug is an effective painkiller in hard-to-treat cases of nerve damage from diabetes or shingles. 

 Separately, a panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration endorsed the first in a potential new line of pain relievers, known as Cox 2 inhibitor drugs. 

 The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers. 

 The Cox 2 inhibitors are being widely touted as potential blockbusters, likely to generate at least $1 billion a year in sales during their first year on the market. Estimates for worldwide sales of all analgesics run as high as $12 billion a year. 

 But many experts doubt the new drugs will live up to their early billing as ``superaspirins.'' The evidence does suggest they cause fewer side effects than ibuprofen and aspirin, even with daily use for many years. But the Cox 2 inhibitors don't seem to control pain much better than current treatments. 

 The FDA-sponsored advisory panel voted to recommend approval of Celebrex, G.D. Searle & Co.'s Cox 2 inhibitor, for both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The vote paves the way for full FDA approval sometime next year. Meanwhile, Merck & Co. has its own Cox 2 inhibitor awaiting approval, and other drugmakers are said to be close behind.

 Patients with pain from nerve damage will not need to wait to try gabapentin _ it's now sold as an anti-convulsant under the brand name Neurontin by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert Co. 

 Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to start prescribing it immediately for pain patients. Many already have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that it works. 

 The new studies were carried out by independent teams of clinical researchers across the country, including doctors at the University of California at San Francisco. 

 Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far fewer side effects. 

 Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS. 

 ``It's a very important advance in pain management,'' said Dr. Edgar Ross, director of the pain management center at Brigham and Women's Medical Center in Boston, who participated in one of the two studies. 

 ``This is the first time we have a drug reasonably well-tolerated by most people and effective for a problem that has been resistant to most treatments.'' 

 A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said the company is evaluating the new evidence, and may seek FDA permission to start promoting Neurontin as a pain remedy. But no decision has been made, she said.
