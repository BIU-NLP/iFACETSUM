NEW YORK (AP)-- Merck & Co. made a $5.2 billion profit last year on nearly $27 billion in sales.

 But the future of the nation's largest drugmaker is uncertain as four of its blockbuster drugs lose patent protection in the next two years, which make them susceptible to competition from cheaper generics. 

 That's why analysts say Merck desperately needs strong sales from its new pain pill Vioxx, which was approved Friday by the Food and Drug Administration and is expected to reach pharmacies in mid-June. 

 Vioxx, though, will have to compete with another new painkiller, Celebrex, which has been the hottest selling drug of the year. 

 Doctors have written 4.4 million prescriptions for Celebrex, jointly marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, since it was launched in early January. Celebrex this spring became the second fastest selling new drug ever, after the anti-impotence pill Viagra. 

 Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors. They offer the same pain relief as traditional arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and intestinal bleeding. 

 Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels. 

 Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis. 

 Celebrex is also approved for osteoarthritis, which is the wear and tear of joints usually linked with aging, as well as for rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body's immune system backfires to cause pain and inflammation. 

 Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can prescribe it for other ailments. As a result, analysts say it is likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably. 

 The battle between the drugs will take place in physician offices as thousands of pharmaceutical sales representatives prod doctors to give out free samples. Heavy consumer advertising should also start later this year. Both drugs also will battle to gain acceptance from managed care companies, which increasingly restrict pharmaceutical coverage. Celebrex is covered by about half of all health maintenance organizations. 

 Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion in annual sales by 2002. 

 For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose U.S. patent protection next year. Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001. 

 Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor. 

 Merck officials play down their reliance on Vioxx. ``We have a lot of products,'' said Wendy Dixon, Merck's vice president of marketing. ``Vioxx is clearly important to us, but we are by no means dependent on the success of Vioxx.'' 

 Many analysts see it differently. 

 Merck is ``extremely dependent'' on Vioxx's success, said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. 

 Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data for Celebrex. Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious gastrointestinal problems. 

 ``We think Merck will be able to do some damage with those numbers,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist.

 The safety of the drugs will only become clear in the months ahead as the drugs are used by hundreds of thousands of patients compared to the few thousand patients which took part in the drugs' testing. 

 Merck officials also hope to convince doctors and patients that Vioxx is a true once a day pill. They note that a significant number of Celebrex users must take the pill twice a day. 

 Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a day. 

 The average wholesale price for Vioxx and Celebrex is $2.02 for the standard dosage. 

 Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.
