WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Muhammad Ali who danced around a generation of heavyweight fighters and set the standard against which all boxers are judged leans deeply into the armrests of his chair and rises. 

 He walks gingerly to a door frame, lingers, leans for a moment into the wall with his right shoulder, and bidding his audience of three to pay attention to the soles of his black high-top sneakers, he levitates. 

 In the moment, the years fall away, as does the Parkinson's disease that has stolen his grace. In the moment, Ali is again, the magician. And the magician has risen. 

 He has come to suburban Boca Raton on a pilgrimage, he says, to return to the days when he floated above the ring and punished his opponents with a beauty so startling everyone looked. 

 ``I'm going to make a comeback,'' Ali says, his gravelly voice barely above a whisper. ``That's my dream.'' 

 He arrived last Tuesday from Canada to begin treatments with Jerry Jacobson, a retired dentist and oral surgeon who lives in Jupiter. 

 Inside an office at West Boca Medical Center, Jacobson is surrounded by acolytes. They are the parents of children with cerebral palsy and brain damage, and they believe in his magic. They sing his praises. They believe that the Jacobson resonator will deliver their children. 

 Ali, too, has come to be saved. Modern medicine, the establishment's best and brightest, have failed him. 

 ``I've been to 15 different doctors,'' Ali says softly, his expression flat. ``None of them have been able to do anything.'' 

 So The Greatest has sat, for five sessions now, on a cushion in a $15 lawn chair between two black, eight-foot high circles. He has sat and prayed that the self-described genius with the white hair and white suit is telling the truth, and has figured out a way to rejigger the particles of his body and deliver him. 

 ``They have no cure,'' he says, again his voice barely audible. ``Maybe next year. In ten years. Next month.'' 

 His mind has never stopped working, his acuity has not been diminished. He closes his eyes in mid-conversation as if he is asleep, and reopens them a moment later, wide-eyed, in mock surprise at the faces looking at him. 

 ``I am the most recognized man on earth,'' he says. ``Of all the movies stars, of all the athletes ...'' He turns to a teenage girl sitting nearby. 

 ``If you saw me on the street, would you recognize me?'' He asks. The girls answer yes. ``Everybody knows who I am,'' he says. A smile crosses his face. 

 It is the face of the most recognized man on earth, and it is waiting to be saved. 

 The legendary boxer is just one of many celebrities Jacobson says he's treated with his signature Jacobson resonance machine, which emits a weak magnetic field. Jacobson is using the electromagnetic machine to treat everything from a bad knee to neurological disorders like Ali's. 

 He is still working on proving the machine will help patients overcome osteoarthritis in the knee so the Food & Drug Administration will give him approval to mass produce the gadgets.

 The machines are built at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. NASA got involved with the help of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tent Lott, R-Miss., after Jacobson promised to mass produce the machines in Mississippi if he receives FDA approval. 

 Researchers must treat at least 135 patients in the study for the FDA. About 70 of them are patients at two centers at West Boca Medical Center _ the Pioneer Services Medical Center and the National Medical and Research Institute. 

 The hospital says it has no affiliation with the research. The companies say they rent space from the hospital. 

 About 120 people are being treated for illnesses that are not part of the FDA study. Most of the patients are seen in suburban Boca Raton; the rest are being treated at clinics at West Gables Rehabilitation Hospital in Miami-Dade County and at Coastal Rehabilitation Medical Center in Gulf Port, Miss., Jacobson said. The treatment is free to those in the FDA study. It costs others about $100 a treatment. 

 And more research is being done at Cornell University in New York and University of Oklahoma. 

 In 1995, Jacobson promised 11-year-old Angelie Diya that he could cure her AIDS with his machine. The young girl had won over many hearts when she told her classmates at Jupiter Farms Elementary School that she had the disease. Diya has been to the clinic for pain-relief treatments, said Fank Caviano, chief operating officer of Pioneer. 

 In the case of Parkinson's, Jacobson theorizes that his machine's magnetic waves will awaken Ali's homeotic genes. He says those are the genes responsible for making all your body parts what they are. Making a liver, a liver; an eye, an eye; a brain, a brain. They shut down after their initial work in young children. 

 Once the homeotic genes are stimulated, Jacobson hopes they will regenerate cells in Ali's brain and produce dopamine, which helps us move. It is the lack of dopamine that results in Parkinson's. 

 ``It's a tough case,'' Jacobson said. ``He is a monumental figure. An icon. We are doing everything in our power to help him.'' 

 Although homeotic genes are described in some medical literature and universities' Web sites, they aren't listed in a widely-used medical dictionary or a term familiar to Dr. Robert Brodner, a West Palm Beach neurosurgeon. 

 And Brodner, who has done brain surgery on about 60 people with Parkinson's, said that regeneration within the brain is ``minimal to nonexistent.'' 

 ``So personally, I don't know what this fellow is talking about. I only hope that he does,'' Brodner said Friday. 

 ``I don't quite believe this, but on the other hand it will be interesting to see the affect and see if this is successful. Any treatment that doesn't have the potential to harm a patient can be considered.'' 

 Without a miracle cure, the prognosis for people with Parkinson's is unknown. 

 Some can last years without any noticeable affects. Some live for more than 40 years with the disease. Others are almost immediately bedridden and incoherent. These conditions make patients susceptible to other problems like choking, pneumonia and falls _ which can result in death. 

 One strike against Ali, a four-time heavyweight champ, is the relatively young age when the Parkinson's set in. Now 56, he was in his early 40s. 

 Ali is not the only sports star to get Jacobson's treatment. Professional Bowlers Association Hall of Famer Dave Davies// of Boynton Beach was in constant pain for more than three years after his right kneecap was broken. His pain disappeared after a partial knee replacement last fall and after treatment at Pioneer. 

 Pro Golfer Doug Tewell, who works for the Golf Channel, also is amazed by the pain relief he's received. He thought he was headed for surgery on his right elbow. But after several treatments with Jacobson in the last month, he is holding off on the operation. 

 ``I had trouble picking up glass with my right arm without severe pain,'' he said. ``I went from severe pain and possible surgery to winning $115,000 in two weeks.''
