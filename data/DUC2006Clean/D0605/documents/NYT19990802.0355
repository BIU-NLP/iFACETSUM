NEW YORK _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from Merck and Monsanto have also been vying to get their attention to promote new arthritis drugs. 

 Monsanto is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug. The company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says Monsanto. 

 But Merck is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of months on the market. And it will soon begin a big advertising push to compete with Monsanto's. 

 These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin. Can celebrity endorsers be far behind? 

 There is plenty riding on this battle. Analysts expect the market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from $7.2 billion worldwide this year to $13 billion by 2005. And for their own reasons, Merck and Monsanto want not just a success but a blockbuster. 

 The scrap is beginning to get interesting. Even though Celebrex, which is being co-marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, controls the market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in May. Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach. 

 In the week ended June 11, Vioxx had 7 percent of the Cox-2 market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry consultant IMS Health. But by July 23, Vioxx accounted for 22 percent of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to 78 percent. 

 ``It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex,'' said Jack Lamberton, a managing director at HSBC Securities. ``But this market is large enough for both drugs.'' 

 The stakes are unusually large. In an industry where earnings tend to rise 15 percent or more a quarter, Monsanto and Merck need a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical companies. 

 After its proposed merger with American Home Products fell apart last year, Monsanto announced a $625 million reorganization. Even though drug makers are generally suffering and the Standard & Poor's drug index is down 14.7 percent this year, Monsanto has done worse. Its stock has slid 17.1 percent this year, to close Monday at $39.375, up 12.5 cents.

 Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock is down only 8.6 percent this year _ but analysts say the company can ill afford a marketing disaster. Several of Merck's drugs will lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives become available. 

 And Merck is no longer Wall Street's darling. During the last 12 months, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have climbed 18.6 percent. Meanwhile, Merck's shares have gained 10.7 percent. They closed Monday at $67.375, down 25 cents. 

 Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis drugs. After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about $2.3 billion a year sometime around 2004, up from a peak estimate of $1.5 billion just months earlier. Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are expected to be about $3 billion by 2004. 

 ``Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness of the brand,'' said Wendy Dixon, a Merck vice president. ``With a condition that involves pain, people talk to each other. A lot of the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth.'' 

 Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla., suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx. 

 ``My doctor changed several of my medications,'' Reese said. ``But I have realized a marked improvement. My right hand is almost normal, when it was about 60 percent functional before.'' 

 Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex. 

 Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest share of a new market seldom relinquishes it. Celebrex, whose sales began in January, had the most successful debut by a drug ever in the United States, eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra, Pfizer's impotence pill, and Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's drug for reducing cholesterol, according to IMS Health. 

 ``We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx,'' said Joseph Papa, president of U.S. operations for Searle, a division of Monsanto. ``We're outperforming them on every measure.'' 

 Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block. Known for its Marine-like marketing efficiency, Merck began shipping Vioxx to pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Merck has also distributed the most free samples in its history. 

 The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other arthritis remedies.
