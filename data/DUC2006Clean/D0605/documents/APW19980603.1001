IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are initially for pain relief. This is followed by drugs that stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation. Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and pain-relieving medicines are used to control them. They include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and locally applied linaments and ointments. In the last five years, a better understanding of various rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies. That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example, cyclosporin. In the last two years, Cox-2 selective NSAIDs (meloxicam) have been introduced around the world for pain relief in rheumatic disorders. They are said to be safer than existing NSAIDs in causing less gastrointestinal complications. Up to now, all existing NSAIDs are known to cause gastric irritation. A certain herbal product has been tried in rheumatic disorders in Denmark. It is based on the patented ginger extract HMP-33 which is extracted from a special variety of ginger found only in one particular region in China. Developed over six years by a Danish team led by biochemist Dr Morten Weidner, it comes in a soft gelatin capsule. It was recently introduced here and is available over the counter. Apparently, one capsule has properties equivalent to 6,600mg of dried ginger. The largest and most recent trial to test the efficacy and safety of HMP-33 was conducted two years ago by a team of doctors from Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, headed by chief rheumatologist Dr Henning Bliddal and principal clinical investigator Dr Allan Rosetzsky. Dr Bliddal and his team had carried out a random double-blind placebo-controlled study on 56 hospital patients suffering from osteoarthritis. The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects. Similar clinical studies are currently being carried out in Australia and the United States. Generally, says a local doctor who requested anonymity, herbal products are not as well tested in clinical trials as medications which have to be registered for use in hospital pharmacies. He adds trials with ginger extracts in rheumatic disorders have not been actively carried out in Malaysia and local doctors are awaiting confirmatory tests before recommending such products to patients. Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for rheumatic patients. Some patients may need disease modifying drugs to prevent fibrosis of the tissues and joints and possibly internal organ damage. Examples of such drugs include sulphasalazine, chloroquine, penicillamine, gold and methotrexate. Steroids in the correct amount and for the proper duration of treatment are given to patients to reduce inflammation which may damage the body. However, these are also the most commonly abused drugs because they are mixed illegally into herbal remedies. Rheumatic disorders cover all medical diseases of the motoric system - bones, joints, muscles and tendons - as well as those related to the connective tissue. The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. That means the treatment of each rheumatic disorder is individualised and aimed at the cause and source of the pain as well as underlying inflammation. Based on Government hospital attendance records one in four Malaysians above 40 visits outpatient clinics for a rheumatic complaint. This is probably the same in private clinics.
