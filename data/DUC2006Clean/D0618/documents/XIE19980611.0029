OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have once again pledged their effort to fight against malaria which is plaguing the world's poorest continent and claiming a large number of lives every year. 

 The 34th assembly of heads of state and government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in a decision calls upon all member states to commit additional human and material resources for malaria prevention and control, including disease surveillance and research, in line with the development of health sector reform. 

 It also asks them to mobilize all partners, public and private, local and foreign, to support the execution of malaria prevention and control activities as part of the economic recovery and development. 

 At the same time, the assembly requests the World Health Organization (WHO) to continue working closely with the OAU to coordinate efforts aimed at the eradication of malaria from the African continent and to increase its level of support in that respect. 

 The summit acknowledged the initiative and critical role played by WHO in 1997, specifically the generous assistance provided by the director-general through the accelerated program of malaria control in Africa, the actions taken to develop strong community-based approaches to ensure sustainability of control and the continuing support in 1998.
