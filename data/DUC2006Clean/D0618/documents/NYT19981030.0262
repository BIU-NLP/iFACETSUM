UNITED NATIONS _ Three major U.N. agencies and the World Bank said Friday that they were joining forces in a coordinated campaign against malaria, a leading killer of the world's poorest people. 

 Malaria, which is reaching epidemic proportions in Africa and parts of Asia, Latin America and the southern fringe of the former Soviet Union, kills about a million people a year, and children are especially vulnerable. Experts say one child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. Around the world, malaria kills 3,000 children under 5 every day, a higher mortality rate than AIDS. 

 Research on prevention and cures for malaria has been all but nonexistent in big pharmaceutical companies for more than two years because the drugs proved not to be money-makers, experts said Friday. At the same time the parasites that cause malaria and the mosquitoes that carry them have alarmed public health officials with their fast-evolving resistance to most known medicines and insecticides. 

 ``We're dealing here with just about the cleverest pathogen that's known to human medical science,'' said Dr. David Nabarro of Britain's foreign aid agency, who will become manager of the anti-malaria program in January. 

 The project will be coordinated by the World Health Organization in Geneva, in cooperation with the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF and the World Bank. 

 The new drive against malaria is the first big project undertaken by the World Health Organization's new director general, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway and a public health specialist. She took over the huge agency in May, vowing to shake it up and make it more responsive to immediate needs. 

 At a news conference Friday she called malaria a cause of rising human suffering that targets the young and the weak, and said her project, to be called Roll Back Malaria, was prompted in large part by calls for help from African leaders. Experts say 90 percent of malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. 

 Dr. Brundtland also said that this project will be a ``pathfinder'' in better U.N. cooperation. The anti-malarial drive will draw on each participating agency's special expertise, pooling resources in an effort to eliminate costly overlaps. It is a policy in line with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's management reforms, which seek to streamline the way the organization works and make it more effective. 

 The leaders of the cooperating agencies said Friday that the anti-malaria drive will include efforts to generate new research in the pharmaceutical industry and to raise money from reluctant governments, as well as local efforts to provide health centers with insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for village beds and packets of fast-acting pills or suppositories for malaria sufferers. 

 The budget for the first year has been estimated at about $19 million for the organizations involved, with additional money being sought from governments where the disease is rampant and the labor force is weakened or reduced as a result. 

 ``Funding is less of an issue than getting governments to focus on malaria,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, at Friday's news conference. ``We are trying to make the case to financiers that this is central to the economic development of Africa.'' 

 James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development Program, said his agency was well placed to look at the environmental situation in countries struck by malaria _ issues of sanitation, for example. He said the ``social fallout'' of malaria was also of concern to his agency. 

 Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, said her organization would focus, as it already does, on local-level work in poor communities, where malaria contributes significantly to a high maternal mortality rate and to a high incidence of anemia among women and children. 

 Nabarro, now strategic director for human development at Britain's Department for International Development, said in an interview Friday that ``collective brainpower'' was necessary if health officials had any hope of even halving malaria deaths in a decade. He said wiping out malaria is an impossible goal.
