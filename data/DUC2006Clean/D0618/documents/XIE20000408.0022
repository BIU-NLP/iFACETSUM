JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Southern African Development Community (SADC) health ministers reached an agreement here on Saturday on coordinating their efforts to combat malaria in the region. 

 The ministers from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe said in a statement that an coordinated approach was essential to contain the spread of malaria. 

 They established a working group to investigate how to secure funds for malaria control plans and made recommendations on key areas in malaria prevention, treatment and control, according to the statement. 

 The statement said the working group was charged to investigate: 

 -- the prediction of unexpected climatic conditions that may adversely influence the incidence of malaria; 

 -- the harmonization of treatment and prophylaxis protocols, vector control and the use of insecticides, taking into account the national scientific evidence and prevailing circumstances; 

 -- developing clear guidelines on the rational use of malaria prophylaxis and treatment during pregnancy; 

 -- examining and developing strategies to manage the effect of cross- border movements; 

 -- the impact of the movement of people on the spread, management and reporting of the disease, and 

 -- examining the extent of private sector influence on drug resistance. 

 The working group sub-committee would report on the progress of the investigations at the annual ministers' meeting next month. 

 The region has been hit by a recent spate of malaria caused by floods sweeping through a number of regional countries.
