HANOI, January 28 (xinhua) -- The number of malaria deaths in Vietnam last year dropped by 70 percent compared with that of 1995, local media reported today. 

 Only 198 cases were reported in the year against 660 cases in 1995. The achievement was attributed to the joint efforts of the medical sector at different levels and the anti-malaria teams preventing outbreaks of the disease. 

 The medical teams have provided medicines to 2-2.5 million people and distributed three million mosquito-nets for malaria prevention in remote and mountainous areas. 

 This year, the health care service plans to promote health care awareness, teach people how to prevent malaria by themselves, help village medical stations to detect malaria patients, and provide mosquito-nets to all people in remote, isolated and mountainous areas.
