GENEVA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will host the first major summit on accelerating action against malaria in Africa on April 25,the World Health Organization (WHO) announced here Wednesday. 

 More than 50 African heads of state, G8 heads of state, the heads of 10 international development agencies and a dozen development and health ministers have been invited to the summit, said WHO. Leaders whose countries are most seriously affected have already accepted. 

 Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo will chair the summit which is being co-organized by WHO. 

 Malaria causes more than one million deaths each year, according to WHO which coordinates the global partnership Roll Back Malaria initiative that aims to halve the numbers of malaria deaths by the year 2020. 

 The majority who die are African children and deaths linked to malaria in Africa overall are increasing, WHO said. 

 At the end of the summit, heads of state will issue a declaration on tackling malaria in Africa and new statistics on the crippling effect malaria has on economic development in African countries will also be launched. 

 One week before the summit, on April 18, the world's largest bednet will be unveiled with hundreds of African school children. The Guinness Book of Records will be present to record the event. 

 WHO hopes that the event will draw attention to the urgent need to provide more insecticide treated bednets in Africa, adding that insecticide treated nets are one of the most effective tools for the prevention and control of malaria.
