KUNMING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of malaria has declined from 249 people per 10,000 in 1953 to 3 per 10,000 in 1996 in southwest China's Yunnan Province, statistics showed. 

 Doctors in Yunnan, a notorious malaria-prevalent region before 1949, have worked hard to discover the characteristics and mechanism concerning the spreading of malaria under the special conditions which exist in the province. 

 The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than 2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment. 

 Doctors also popularize knowledge on malaria prevention among people of various minority groups which are numerous in the province. 

 Since the 1990s, the institute has received 56 experts and researchers from 11 countries on academic exchanges and cooperation projects. 

 The research of the institute has been aided for seven consecutive years by the World Health Organization.
