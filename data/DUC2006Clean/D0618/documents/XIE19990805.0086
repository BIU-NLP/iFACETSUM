LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent research study in Nigeria has shown that children under six months old could suffer from malaria, a situation which was previously considered unimaginable. 

 Scientists hold that children at that age and below were never thought to have malaria parasites because it was assumed they were protected from the disease by the immunity acquired at birth, the Panafrican News Agency reported Wednesday. 

 However, the study says that the discovery could assist medical practitioners to adequately treat infant babies who presented vague symptoms of malaria. 

 The study, sponsored by the African Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, aims at ascertaining the current trend of the malaria scourge among communities along the coastal areas of Nigeria. 

 Dr. Bamigboye Afolabi, who led a team of the researchers in Ibeshe Island, an isolated coastal village in Lagos State, said that about 30 percent of the 450 children seen in the first part of the study had malaria parasite. 

 "This research will definitely lead to improvement in the tools for diagnosis and treatment of malaria and its prevention," he said. "Most importantly, it will not only reduce the severity of the ailment among pregnant women and children, but reduce the high mortality due to the disease." 

 Afolabi said that the detailed result of the study had been forwarded to the WHO, adding that its findings could be applicable to other parts of tropical Africa, as well as other malaria endemic regions. 

 Statistics show that more than 80 percent of the population of sub- Saharan Africa are at risk of malaria. 

 According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, "of the approximately 300 million cases of malaria estimated to occur globally every year, over 85 percent are from Africa, and of the estimated two to three million annual deaths, over 90 percent are in Africa."
