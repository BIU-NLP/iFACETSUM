WASHINGTON(AP) -- Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne infection. 

 The Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone, the first new anti-malaria option in 11 years. 

 Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's worst scourges. It sickens at least 300 million people every year and kills up to 2.7 million. Drugs and insecticides have made it rare in developed countries, but it is almost impossible to escape in tropical, developing nations. Worse, it is evolving to resist many treatments. 

 Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle ache and malaise. Without prompt treatment, kidney failure and other problems can cause death. People who become ill with a fever during or after tropical travel should see a doctor and make sure to mention the trip, the FDA advised. Also, people planning travel to a malaria-endemic country should see a doctor first about prevention. 

 Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s Malarone was approved to prevent and treat malaria in adults and children. It combines two medications: atovaquone, used to treat lung infections in immune-compromised patients, and proguanil, an old malaria therapy. 

 In four clinical trials in Africa, two out of 279 people who used Malarone for three months developed malaria. In comparison, 92 out of another 297 people who took a placebo developed malaria. 

 Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria treatment, too. 

 The main side effects were headache and abdominal pain; children also reported vomiting and itching. 

 Glaxo said the prescription drug will be available in mid-August but would not reveal a price.
