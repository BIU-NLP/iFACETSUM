NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is resurging in many countries where it has been sharply reduced or even eradicated and more than a third of the world's total population now live in malaria endemic areas, experts say Wednesday. 

 It is estimated that 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria each year, about twice as many as 20 years ago, according to papers presented at the third Pan-African Conference on Malaria which ended here Wednesday. 

 About 100 experts and senior health officials from 34 African countries attended the continent's top-level anti-malaria meeting which started Sunday. 

 Currently the number of countries and regions suffering from the disease reaches 100, said a press release issued by the conference. 

 Annual number of deaths of children under five years of age attributed to malaria hits one million, the experts said, "During the last 10 years, malaria has killed 10 times more children than all the wars that have raged over the same period." 

 Rapidly increased drug resistance is leaving populations with no effective drug for prevention against or treatment of the eighth lethal killer in the world -- the top one in Africa -- the experts noted. 

 "Malaria is thus much more lethal in 1998 than in 1968," they claimed. 

 "There is urgent need for research into new malaria compounds" and more urgent need for enhanced joint efforts especially by African countries to fight the disease, they said. Sub-Saharan Africa hosts more than 90 percent of Malaria victims. 

 "At present, the only organized effort, in the continent, addressing this issue (malaria) systematically is the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network," said Assistant Executive Secretary Robert Mshana of the Organization of African Unity. 

 The conference is aimed at enabling experts to exchange scientific findings on epidemiology, therapeutic strategies and the implementation of national anti-malaria programs. 

 The participants also studied the possibilities for the establishment of a multi-national South-South cooperation on researches and training in the field.
