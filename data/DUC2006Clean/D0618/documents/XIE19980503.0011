HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa is optimistic in its endeavors to eradicate malaria which has affected the social and economic development of the continent, health experts meeting in Harare said. 

 The experts who met for the two-day preparatory committee meeting on the African initiative for malaria control in the 21st century were from different institutions affiliated to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday. 

 According to a provisional report released Saturday in Harare, the meeting which ended Thursday resolved to develop an effective and timely malaria surveillance and information system. 

 That would help develop a practical malaria control strategy in all malaria endemic countries by the year 2005. 

 It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa. 

 The targets adopted by the meeting included reduction of malaria mortality by 50 percent by the year 2010, and reduce by at least half the socio-economic negatives of malaria. 

 The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the strategy which channeled 10 million U.S. Dollars towards malaria control in Africa last year. 

 A further boost to their initiatives was through the commitment of African leaders to combat the disease as evidenced by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Harare Declaration on Malaria Prevention and Control signed in June 1997 in Zimbabwe's capital city. 

 The meeting also suggested that a competent interim secretariat be urgently recruited. The secretariat would have a degree of operational independence from WHO. 

 It was also recommended at the meeting that an African Initiative for Malaria (AIM) steering committee be elected based on a coalition of major stakeholders and medical personnel to develop the fight against malaria.
