MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has made a big stride in malaria control with malaria infections rate in the country is now generally low, a senior health official said today. 

 Malaria infection rate in the Philippine has been reduced from a yearly 7.4 per 1000 in 1994 to 3.8 per 1000 in 1996, according to Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica. 

 "The massive infusion of logistics, training of key personnel, the active support of local governments and communities, have resulted to the marked improvement of the malaria situation in the past six years," Reodica said in a statement. 

 From 1991 to 1996, the health chief noted, the confirmed cases of malaria were reduced from 86,392 to 39,855. 

 The malaria control program is being implemented by the Department of Health through its regional field offices in collaboration with 824 local government workers, she said. 

 Although funding for the program has been drastically reduced, "the achievement in control and prevention is significant," Reodica said. 

 The Philippines is also in step with the World Health Organization target of a 50 percent reduction in Malaria cases in the Western Pacific region in the year 2000, she added. 

 The health department has recently officially declared the elimination of Malaria in 13 provinces out of 78 provinces in the country. 

 Reodica said that out of the remaining provinces where malaria is endemic, 16 have infection rates of less than one per l000 population per year, three have had no indigenous case in the past two years. 

 The malaria problems in the country are mainly concentrated among farmers, forest workers, charcoal makers, migrant workers and settlers in hard-to-reach communities, including provincial boarders, cultural minorities slash and frontier areas, she said.
