 HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today reaffirmed their "unflagging resolve" to prevent the outbreak of malaria which claims 4,200 lives every day on the continent. 

 The leaders, ending their 33rd summit here, issued a declaration which considers malaria control in Africa as one of the continent's priority programs. 

 The declaration said African countries "support fully the implementation of the Global and Regional Strategy and approaches recommended by the World Health Organization." 

 African countries, the declaration said, will implement well planned and coordinated malaria control programs involving individuals, families, communities, institutions, relevant government ministries, and other public and private sectors. 

 The declaration called on African countries to allocate sufficient human, financial and material resources, and mobilize other local resources including resources from non-governmental and private and civil sectors, for the sustained prevention and control of malaria in Africa. 

 Efforts should also be made to mobilize additional external resources from international agencies, governmental and non-governmental agencies, foundations and industrial and commercial enterprises to support national and commercial action to control malaria and surveillance to prevent epidemics and sustain the progress already made, the declaration said. 

 It suggested the following actions: 

 -- Give full political support to actions directed towards sustainable malaria preventioan and control as an urgent priority; 

 -- Further develop and implement plans for malaria prevention and control, including incorporation into development projects based on environmental and health impact assessments; 

 -- Develop strong community based programs to mobilize active community participation for malaria prevention and control; 

 -- Promote and support micro-financing schemes, especially for women, to initiate income generating projects aimed at basic environmental and household improvements; 

 -- Develop mechanisms that will facilitate and ensure well coordinated multisectoral action to reduce substantially the burden of malaria and promote inter-country collaboration and coordination of efforts; and 

 -- Promote basic and operational research to ensure that new tools, including vaccines, are made available without delay and existing ones are used in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.
