HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Africa said here Monday it was preparing for a program that would progressively reduce illnesses and deaths due to malaria to a minimum in Africa over the next 25 years. 

 The program, called African Initiative for Malaria Control in the 21st century (AIM), will be launched next year and will cover all the 46 countries in Africa. 

 In a statement, the WHO said the initiative will be implemented in phases and was expected to reduce malaria illnesses and deaths in the region by 50 percent by the year 2010. 

 "The ultimate goal, according to WHO, is that by the year 2030, malaria will neither be the major contributor to mortality and morbidity nor significant socio-economic consequence," said the statement. 

 Malaria is one of the leading health problems in Africa, especially in sub-Sahara region. About 550 million people in the African region risk the disease. 

 The disease attacks between 270 and 480 million people and kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million each year. 

 The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and insecticides. 

 "The economic consequences of malaria-related diseases are enormous. The direct and indirect losses due to malaria in the region rose from 800 million U.S. Dollars in 1987 to more than 2,000 million U.S. Dollars in 1997," the statement said. 

 The key features of the implementation of the initiative will be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of insecticide-impregnated nets, prevention and strengthening of the capacities of countries and communities to combat the disease, according to the statement.
