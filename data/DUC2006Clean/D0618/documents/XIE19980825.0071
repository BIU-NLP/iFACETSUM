HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaria spread in 14 central and central highland provinces of Vietnam in the first seven months this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday. 

 The number of malaria patients and deaths increased by 5.71 percent and 14.9 percent respectively in these provinces. 

 Seven of 14 provinces in the region saw rapid increases in the number of malaria patients, and 54 deaths were reported. 

 32 villages in seven communes of Tra My district of Quang Nam province had outbreaks of malaria, with 15,000 people infected. 

 The worsening epidemic is attributed to neglect of prevention measures against the deadly disease. Unseasonably warm weather, which caused the rapid development of mosquito sectors, low standards of living, limited awareness of malaria and a weak health care network were other factors to blame. 

 To remedy the situation, local health care networks would be strengthened, disease prevention facilities better supplied and awareness on malaria prevention raised, reports said. enditem nnnn
