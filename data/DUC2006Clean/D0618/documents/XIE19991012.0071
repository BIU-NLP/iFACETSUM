DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye Monday called on people to use insecticide treated nets to prevent mosquito from spreading malaria. 

 Sumaye made the appeal while opening the Second International Conference on Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam. 

 He said in Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of outpatient services and the number one cause of child mortality. Statistics indicated that 25- 42 percent of outpatient visits and 25 percent of deaths reported in Tanzanian health facilities are due to the disease. 

 Malaria is also a major impediment to social and economic development throughout Africa, he said, adding that it is estimated that by the year 2000 the annual direct economic cost of malaria across Africa will exceed 3. 5 billion U.S. dollars, twice what it was in 1995. 

 He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on malaria related illness. For example, outpatient treatment of malaria accounts for up to 40 percent of Africa's public health expenditure. 

 The recent emergence and spread of malaria resistant to chloroquine, a drug that has saved millions of lives for over five decades, further highlights the need to promote new strategies to protect vulnerable populations from infection and put our emphasis on preventative measures, he noted. 

 The use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the key components of prevention, he said. 

 He said based on field trials in Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana, it has been established that when properly used ITNs could reduce mortality by more than 30 percent, and hospitalization by more than 40 percent. 

 "We learnt also that malaria could be prevented, and more than 500,000 lives could be saved each year (C if ITNs were widely available to many households in Africa," he said. 

 Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Prime Minister said that the fight against malaria by destroying habitat of mosquitoes has to continue, adding that people need to clean their surroundings by cutting grass and shrubs around houses and destroying stationary water ponds. 

 The conference, sponsored by the London-based Malaria Consortium, has attracted more than 230 delegates from some 40 countries across the world. The first conference was held in Washington in 1997.
