LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of racist incidents continues to rise, according to the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) on Wednesday. 

 It said fewer people turned to the CRE for help last year, despite the increased prominence given to race issues following the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. 

 Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death in a racist murder in 1993 at a bus-stop in Eltham, south-east London. No one has been charged with his murder. 

 The CRE warned of worrying signs that the number of racist incidents is still going up. Since the 1980s, the ratio of black and Asian people who are unemployed compared with the white population has risen sharply. 

 The commission was calling for reform of the Race Relations Act to include the police, and said there must be a determination to make racial equality a reality.
