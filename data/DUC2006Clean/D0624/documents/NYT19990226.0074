LONDON Stephen Lawrence was the picture of a typical English lad. 

 On that April night in 1993, the 18 year old was neatly dressed and well-groomed as he waited for a bus to take him the last leg home to his prim middle class London suburb. He was a good student with dreams of becoming an architect. People knew him as courteous, intelligent and sociable. 

 But because he was also black, he was attacked by a gang of white thugs and stabbed to death. 

 Lawrence's death and the bungled police investigation that failed to bring his killers to justice generated an extraordinary level of anger and frustration among blacks that last year, after more than five years of pressure, finally moved the government to conduct a formal inquiry. 

 On Wednesday, Home Secretary Jack Straw stood solemnly in Parliament to report the findings. The report was startling in its condemnation of Scotland Yard's investigation of the murder and its conclusion that the respected police force and by implication much of British society is plagued by racism. 

 Racism tainted every turn of the investigation, the report said. Investigators were slow to respond to statements made by black witnesses and treated with suspicion the account of the incident offered by Lawrence's friend, another black man, who witnessed the crime. 

 Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk, the report said. 

 Even Lawrence's grieving parents were treated badly, the report said. 

 ''From the first contact with police officers at the hospital, and thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence were treated with insensitivity and lack of sympathy,'' the report said. ``They were patronized. They were never given information about the investigation to which they were entitled.'' 

 Because the initial investigation was so flawed, the prosecution of three of the five suspects failed to win convictions and crown prosecutors dropped the cases against the other two. The government now is considering a change in its rules with regard to double jeopardy protections to prosecute the young men again if more evidence can be developed against them. 

 In the meantime, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is promising a full assault on racism, including moves to broaden anti-discrimination laws to cover now-exempt police and government departments. The government also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London that are suspected of being racially motivated. 

 Yet, Lawrence's parents, who were present in the House of Commons to hear the results of the inquiry, seemed little comforted. 

 ''No one is serving time for the murder of my son,'' Doreen Lawrence later told reporters. 

 ''To me, institutional racism is so ingrained, and it is hard to see how it will be eradicated out of the police force.''

 While the 10-week inquiry focused on the culture and practices of Scotland Yard, the findings are being interpreted as an appraisal of race relations in Britain as a whole. 

 In the days before and after the release of the report, the Lawrence case was the dominant news story. Major newspapers dedicated several pages to the story on Thursday and Friday and it was the main topic on talk TV and radio. 

 To many, Lawrence has become the symbol of racial struggle in a country that has never really had a U.S.-style civil rights movement. 

 ``His name will resonate in a way that no other individual in British black history has done before,'' said Stuart Hall, visiting professor in sociology at the Open University. ``It will stand for the fact that this time we were able to smoke out prejudice.'' 

 Young blacks in particular have embraced Lawrence, in whom they see someone familiar. Posters and T-shirts bearing his likeness are common in London. 

 ``I think black teenagers identify with him because they are at the sharp edge,'' Hall said. ``They are saying that the police prejudice shown in Stephen's case has been going on for a long time.'' 

 Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, believes the Lawrence case will leave an indelible mark. ``There has never been a civil rights movement in this country, therefore there has never been something to touch the heart of the community,'' Herbert said. ``There has never been a black martyr in this country, but that is what Stephen has become.''

 While Britain takes pride in its tolerance, it remains a place of contradictions in its attitudes toward blacks. Last year, a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was set among 20th Century martyrs above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, the only American granted such an honor. 

 Yet, tourist shops routinely sell figurine models of blacks in insulting stereotypical poses long vanished from the American South. In Cornwall, residents celebrate with little controversy an annual festival called ``Darkie Days,'' during which locals in wigs and blackface sing and dance in the streets to commemorate the landing of a slave ship 200 years ago. 

 Despite a 50-year influx of blacks and Asians from former colonies, Britain remains overwhelmingly white. Less than 6 percent of the 58 million residents are members of minorities and most live in major cities such as London. For many Britons the only contact they have with blacks is through American films and sitcoms. 

 While the common belief in Britain is that race relations here are better than they are in the United States, recent studies indicate powerful similarities between the plight of blacks in both countries. 

 A 1993 study found that 62 percent of young black men in London were unemployed. Four of the five boroughs with the highest concentration of black people are in the top 10 most deprived districts in the country. Black boys are four times more likely to be excluded from school than their white peers. Black people aged 16-24 are twice as likely to be unemployed as whites. Black people are more likely to be stopped, searched and imprisoned than whites. They receive longer sentences and are more likely to die in custody. 

 Despite recent public efforts to put more blacks in visible positions such as newscasters and political leaders, 80 percent of 18-to 34-year-olds from ethnic minorities feel race relations have worsened in recent years, according to a report by the University of Warwick's Center for Research in Ethnic Elections. 

 Acknowledging the challenge Britain faces in coming to grips with race relations, Blair said the Lawrence case offers a place from which the effort must rise. 

 ''This is a general problem we have to face as a society,'' Blair said in a television interview. 

 ''It will require a determination that the real monument to Stephen Lawrence is not to be found in the laws passed by Parliament, but in the fundamental change in attitude in our society.''
