LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank Dobson vowed Wednesday to keep racism out of the health service after reports that human organs had been donated on condition they were given to white patients. 

 The reports cast a new cloud over race relations in Britain, already strained after the police force was found to be racist following its bungled investigation into the 1993 murder of black youth Stephen Lawrence. 

 "I have not been the opponent of the apartheid movement for the whole of my adult life to see it introduced in the National Health Service," Dobson said while touring a hospital outside London with Prime Minister Tony Blair, according to local media reports. 

 Dobson later told ITN television news he would introduce rules preventing donors from choosing the race of the person to receive their organs if rules were deemed necessary. 

 "It had never occurred to me that a rule would be necessary to keep racism out of blood transfusion and transplants," Dobson said. "If it is necessary to introduce a rule, we'll introduce it." 

 On Tuesday Dobson ordered an inquiry into a case revealed by BBC television in which a donor's family told the Northern General Hospital in the city of Sheffield last July that the recipient of their relative's kidneys must be white. 

 Black Labor MP Bernie Grant, himself awaiting a kidney transplant, condemned race-selective organ donations and called on Dobson to get to the bottom of the case. 

 "It's an outrage of enormous proportions," Grant was quoted by Reuters as saying. "It challenges the whole basis of the NHS as a universal service in which black and white life is of equal value." 

 "We were promised things would change and there wouldn't be the official reluctance to stamp out racism there has been in the past," Grant said. "It's up to Frank Dobson to take some urgent disciplinary action and find who was behind this." 

 Race relations campaigners expressed outrage at the kidney transplant report, with Assembly Against Racism spokesman Kumar Mushid calling it "incomprehensible" for people engaging in an act of humanity by allowing the use of an organ to be imposing racist conditions on its use.
