LONDON _ The Metropolitan Police, whose friendly London ``bobby'' made it one of the most recognizable police forces in the world, is institutionally racist, according to a British government report released Wednesday. 

 In the most comprehensive examination of race relations in Britain in nearly 20 years, Sir William Macpherson, a retired judge, concluded that the London police force is riven with ``pernicious and institutionalized racism,'' and that racism among the police reflects a problem in the wider society. 

 The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the 800-page report by announcing a radical overhaul of the country's racial discrimination laws, saying they would now apply to the police and all government agencies. 

 A solemn Blair told the House of Commons Wednesday that the report on racism was ``an important moment in the life of the country.'' 

 ``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still exists in our society,'' Blair told lawmakers. ``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to change.'' 

 The report, commissioned after police botched the investigation into the 1993 racially motivated murder of a black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, has put pressure on Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police chief, to resign. But Condon, whose seven-year term expires in January, said he will not step down and the British government issued a vote of confidence in him after the report was released. 

 According to British government sources, Condon saved his job by accepting the findings of Macpherson's report, and especially by accepting the sweeping new definition of institutional racism issued by Macpherson. 

 He defines it as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture and ethnic origin.'' 

 Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated racism. 

 In a city where more than 20 percent of the residents are minorities, only 2 percent of the police force is. Minorities make up more than 5 percent of the population in all of Britain, but less than 2 percent of all police officers. 

 The murder of Lawrence, 18, has put police under scrutiny like never before. But it has also touched off a wider national debate about racism, and now brought about major reform. 

 Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who are natives of Jamaica, gave the report a guarded welcome, though they said they were disappointed it had not called for the prosecution of five suspects in their son's murder for perjury. Three of the suspects were acquitted in a civil prosecution brought by the Lawrences, but the report calls for allowing even those acquitted of crimes to be tried again if new compelling evidence emerges. 

 The Lawrences, who watched from the visitors' gallery in Parliament as Home Secretary Jack Straw announced a series of reforms, said they were heartened that Macpherson had declared that institutional racism was a major problem in Britain. 

 ``For the first time, a lot of people are aware of the situation,'' Neville Lawrence said at a news conference, urging people to ``try and do some good in the name of my son.'' 

 The tone and sweeping conclusions of Macpherson's report surprised even civil rights campaigners who have long complained that the British establishment is in denial about the extent of racism in their country. When he was a High Court justice, Macpherson had a reputation for being a conservative and part of the very establishment he was asked to critique. Lawrence's parents initially complained about his appointment to review the police. 

 Some criticized Macpherson's report as being too sweeping in its conclusions and more aimed at being sensitive to grievances of minorities than providing realistic solutions to complex social problems. 

 Fred Broughton, chairman of the police federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file police officers, said he does not believe the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist and called Macpherson's report ``grossly unfair.'' He said the charge of racism is being thrown around carelessly. 

 He acknowledged that some officers investigating the Lawrence murder may have been insensitive to the victim's family, but added, ``There can be no justification for a blanket allegation that the police did not care about this murder because the victim was black.'' 

 The Lawrences, whose dignity and tenacity in demanding justice has impressed many Britons, have repeatedly called for Condon to step down, saying someone has to be accountable for the incompetence and racial insensitivity by police that allowed their son's killers to escape prosecution. 

 But Straw, who is in charge of law enforcement, Wednesday backed Condon as the ideal person to implement the 70 recommendations to improve policing made in Macpherson's report. Straw ordered that all unsolved murder cases in London be reopened. Some of those murders are thought to be racially motivated. 

 At a news conference, Condon accepted the findings, including the new definition of institutional racism. He had previously denied steadfastly that his force was institutionally racist. 

 ``We in the Met feel a sense of shame,'' he said. 

 Condon received bipartisan support in Parliament. 

 ``A hunt for scapegoats will help no one,'' said the opposition leader, William Hague. 

 While resigning from governmental posts for the errors of subordinates has a long tradition in Britain, Condon said morale within the force would collapse if he allowed himself to become a scapegoat for the botched investigation and the bitterness it has provoked among minorities. He said he made combating racism one of his top priorities, devoted his first speech as chief to the subject, and has doubled the number of minority officers on the Met during his tenure. 

 Bernie Grant, one of the few blacks in Parliament, said the report was a wakeup call for white Britons. 

 ``This is the last chance for British society to tackle racism,'' he said, suggesting that failing to do so could eventually lead to a repeat of the 1981 riots in Brixton, a black section of London.
