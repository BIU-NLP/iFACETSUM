LONDON _ Which new play has provoked the most attention in the British theater so far this year? Which has garnered the most column inches in the press, the most hours on television, and by far the most enthusiastic reviews? 

 No, the answer is not some striking drama at the National or a searing satire at the Royal Court. It has been a defiantly undemonstrative, unpretentiously devastating piece called ``The Color of Justice'' that opened in January in the little Tricycle Theater in the unfashionable North London area of Kilburn and went on to replace a revival of ``Annie'' at a 1,500-seat theater in the West End, where it ended its run Saturday. 

 It has been a startling phenomenon, given that the subject was the murder of a quiet teen-ager in an obscure corner of Southeast London way back in 1993, and yet it isn't an altogether surprising one. Nothing in 1999 has kept British reporters, pundits and editorial writers busier than a long-awaited, much-leaked and now officially published report into the aftermath of the killing of an 18-year-old whose only known offense was to have been born black. 

 Think of the impact in the United States of the recent conviction of a white racist in the Texas dragging case, and of the shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant early last month by police officers in the Bronx. That will give you some idea of the soul-searching that the Lawrence case, as it has become known, has continued to provoke _ not least in that 2,500-year-old forum for public inquiry, the theater. 

 Stephen Lawrence, by all accounts a promising student and good-natured young man, was waiting for a bus in suburban Eltham in April 1993 when one or more members of a group of white youths stabbed him to death after using a racial epithet, a witness said. 

 The case against the prime suspects has never been officially prosecuted, though they were tried and acquitted when lawyers acting for Stephen's parents instituted what is known in Britain as a private prosecution against them. The case subsequently collapsed because the trial judge thought the evidence inadequate. 

 But the victim's parents always refused to let go. They prompted an outcry against racial violence loud enough to reach the ears of President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who met with them when he visited London. The couple embarrassed the police into holding what is now agreed to have been a totally unsatisfactory inquiry into its own handling of the case. &UR; 

 &LR;  And when the Labor Party took office in 1997, the issue was still sufficiently alive for the incoming Home Secretary to order a new, fully public inquiry under an eminent judge, Sir William Macpherson. 

 He delivered his report late last month, and it was even more unsettling than the commentators prophesied. The London police stood accused of botching and bungling the murder investigation not only because of incompetence but because of ``institutionalized racism.'' 

 Whether the government accepts Sir William's more radical recommendations _ that racist language in private places become a crime; that victims themselves should decide what offenses are and are not racially motivated; that individuals acquitted of one crime may sometimes be retried for the same one _ it has already announced it will toughen Britain's anti-racism laws and act to cleanse the police. 

 Why such public and parliamentary outrage? That, ``The Color of Justice'' made clear along its trip from Kilburn to the Theater Royal in the East London district of Stratford, in a showing on the BBC, and at the Victoria Palace in the West End. 

 The play consists of extracts of evidence given to the Macpherson inquiry and edited by the journalist and dramatist Richard Norton-Taylor. In performance, it seemed as fresh as the O.J. Simpson trial and yet as old in its implications as Aeschylus' ``Oresteia.'' As more than one critic suggested, the play vitally concerns the health not just of society's custodians but of society itself. 

 The Tricycle has long reflected the special nature of Kilburn, which is sometimes thought to be the most culturally mixed urban area in Europe. It has given world or British premieres to plays by black writers _ including Mustapha Matura's ``Playboy of the West Indies,'' the work of the American August Wilson and several imports from the Market Theater in Johannesburg _ and to many works by Irish writers. &UR; 

 &LR;  The theater also has plenty of experience in documentary drama. Recently, it staged extracts from the Nuremberg trials, from hearings at the Hague into war crimes in Bosnia, and from an official inquiry into British arms exports to Iraq.

 In Nicolas Kent's production of ``The Color of Justice,'' as in those pieces, everything was so matter-of-fact that you felt you were not in a place of entertainment but the gallery Sir William reserved for the public. The lawyers sat in gray pews in front of boxed files and video screens. People wandered in, whispered, dropped pens, chewed nibs, yawned, wandered out. &UR; 

 &LR;  The downbeat tone extended to the witnesses. Actors who didn't look at all like actors described in bald, banal yet riveting words the investigation Sir William has now condemned so unequivocally. 

 Prodded by the Lawrences' silkily menacing counsel, Jeremy Clyde's Michael Mansfield, and the other attorneys, the witnesses confronted question after question. &UR; 

 &LR;  Did the police who originally arrived on the scene assume Stephen was a hoodlum himself? Why didn't they give him first aid or instantly start a proper hue and cry? Why weren't the suspects arrested far earlier than they were? Why did camera surveillance begin just too late to record one of them taking a trash bag crammed with clothes from his house? Why have so many police notes disappeared? How much did it matter that one investigating officer had a decidedly unprofessional relationship with a drug baron who was also a suspect's father? 

 Norton-Taylor did not alter a single word of the inquiry's transcript and added nothing of his own; however he did cut the 11,000 pages of evidence to a 100-page script. The audience heard endless quibbles about what is and isn't a racial attack, as well as a junior officer earnestly claiming to ``understand black people'' because she was raised in Africa. &UR; 

 &LR;  A very senior policeman offered a fulsome apology to the Lawrences for his force's failures and, using a word the inquiry had already deemed inappropriate, went on to justify the disproportionately frequent arrest of blacks because ``colored people'' tend to live in high-crime areas. 

 The suspects were subpoenaed by the inquiry, but only one was seen in the play. He failed to remember being shown a police surveillance video in which his brother and their friends violently brandish knives and speak in obscene terms of their desire to dismember blacks. &UR; 

 &LR;  The good samaritan, whose wife cradled the dying student, whispering ``you are loved'' into his ear, admitted he initially wondered if the boy was a mugger faking a collapse. After the murder, he washed his bloodstained hands and poured the water on a rosebush in his garden, ``So in a way, I suppose, he is kind of living on a bit.'' It is impossible not to feel that in other, subtler yet more substantial ways, Stephen really is. 

 Is it crazy to claim that, when they gathered to see a jury of Athenians decide how much responsibility Orestes had for his mother's death, Aeschylus' audiences were in a parallel predicament to those at ``The Color of Justice''? &UR; 

 &LR;  It is not merely that effective drama has often been forensic in content and style and has concerned itself with trying to root out difficult truths. It is that an effective theater should regularly address us as citizens and ask us whether or not our community is just or unjust. 

 At the end of ``The Color of Justice,'' Michael Culver's self-effacing, punctilious Macpherson echoed what the real Sir William did at the end of the first inquiry. He asked everyone to stand silently in memory of Stephen. For once we all felt implicated in something that was, yes, a play, but also a significant civic happening.
