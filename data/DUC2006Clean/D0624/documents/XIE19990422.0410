LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The parents of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against the men suspected of his killing. 

 They are also taking action against the Metropolitan Police over the failed investigation into the murder. No one has been convicted of the killing, according to BBC report. 

 The move comes the day before the sixth anniversary of Stephen's death and narrowly beats the six-year deadline for launching civil actions. 

 If the case goes ahead, the five key suspects may be cross-examined in a court for the first time. 

 Three of the suspects -- Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences collapsed. 

 This meant they could not face further criminal charges for the murder. 

 The action against the police comes amid ongoing negotiations with Scotland Yard over compensation. 

 The police have offered Lawrence's parents 50,000 pounds (78,000 U.S. dollars) each for mishandling the investigation into their son's murder in Eltham, south London in 1993.
