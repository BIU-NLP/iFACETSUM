LONDON (AP) -- One minority leader warned today that volunteers will begin patrolling Southall, a racially mixed south London district, to prevent further bombings by a white supremacist group. 

 Police and other organizations have posted an $80,000 reward for the arrest of the neo-Nazis from Combat 18 who have been attacking minorities, most recently setting a bomb off Saturday that injured seven people in Brick Hall, a district in London's East End. 

 Metropolitan police Assistant Commissioner David Vaness said police feared ``a continuing series of vicious attacks,'' possibly spreading to other cities. 

 Suresh Gover said 100 volunteers from the Southall Monitoring Project and local mosques and temples would patrol Southall next Saturday wearing distinctive armbands. 

 ``We have suffered a long history of racial hostility ... but this is racial terrorism,'' he said. 

 Another group in the central England city of Leicester, the Montserrat Community Association, warned that vigilante groups might take to the streets if the attacks continue, the Times of London reported today. 

 On Saturday, in the second attack in eight days, a bomb exploded in Brick Lane, which has a high concentration of Bangladeshis. Combat 18 claimed responsibility for it. 

 The group was also among four far-right organizations that each claimed to have planted a nail bomb April 17 that injured 39 people in Brixton, a racially mixed south London neighborhood. 

 Police said the two attacks, both with crude nail bombs, appeared linked and were clearly racially motivated. 

 In addition, several black lawmakers reported receiving threatening letters signed by ``White Wolves,'' a name that has cropped up before under racist threats. 

 London's Sunday Telegraph reported that a 15-page document signed ``White Wolves'' and giving instructions on orchestrating a bombing campaign was faxed to a radio station a week before the Brixton bombing. 

 One of Britain's largest Asian community newspapers also received a threatening letter from the ``White Wolves,'' its editor said Sunday. 

 Britain's state-funded Commission for Racial Equality said the bombings were a backlash against an official inquiry into the bungled police investigation of the fatal stabbing of a black London teen-ager in 1993. The report, released in February, said the London police force was riddled with racism. 

 Five white youths suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence have never been successfully prosecuted. 

 Commission chairman Claude Moreas said far-right elements ``don't like the idea of lifting the rock and seeing racism underneath.''
