LONDON (AP) -- Declaring that the racially motivated killing of a black teen-ager shamed the nation, the British government today ordered a major overhaul of race laws. 

 The order followed today's release of an official report that said London's police force is riddled with racial prejudice. 

 ``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still exists in our society,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told a hushed House of Commons. ``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to change.'' 

 The government released the report of a judicial inquiry that said the police inquiry into the 1993 fatal stabbing of 17-year-old Stephen Lawrence was marked by ``professional incompetence and institutional racism.'' 

 Five white youths suspected of killing Lawrence while he waited at a bus stop with a black friend have never been successfully prosecuted. All five denied involvement. 

 Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister in charge of the police, announced that laws making racial discrimination an offense will be broadened to include the police and all government departments. 

 He also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London and tighter disciplinary regulations for police. 

 In addition, appeal judges may for the first time be empowered to permit suspects to be tried twice for the same offense if there is new evidence. 

 Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged again because they were acquitted. 

 The killing of Lawrence, whose Jamaican-born parents came to Britain 30 years ago, provoked a national debate. It has also come to epitomize what some see as underlying racism in a nation where race riots are rare and laws barring discrimination already are wide-ranging. 

 ``There was only one reason for this murder. Stephen was black,'' Straw told lawmakers as the teen-ager's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, watched from the visitors' gallery in the House of Commons. 

 The report by retired judge Sir William Macpherson also said that an internal police inquiry into the handling of the Lawrence investigation was ``flawed and indefensible.'' 

 A section of the report, which had been leaked to the media earlier, said London's overwhelmingly white Metropolitan police force was plagued by ``institutional racism.'' 

 ``It can be seen, or detected in processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination ... which disadvantages ethnic minority people,'' the report said. 

 Straw said Lawrence's killing and its repercussions had given whites -- 93 percent of the population -- a look at what it is like to be black or Asian in Britain. 

 ``Some of the truths are uncomfortable,'' said Straw, adding he wanted the report to be a catalyst for irrevocable change nationwide.
