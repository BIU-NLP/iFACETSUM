LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands. 

 The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race relations.'' 

 Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin'' reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.'' 

 His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that ``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the community in the way that policing by consent demands.'' 

 Among the recommendations were measures making individual officers liable for legal judgments of up to $800,000 for racist behavior, giving the Commission for Racial Equality statutory power to investigate the police, making racist language even in private conversations criminally punishable, changing the national schools curriculum to emphasize cultural diversity and improve race awareness and empowering the Court of Appeal to allow acquitted defendants to be tried anew if compelling new evidence comes to light. 

 The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history of race baiting. Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances to the way Lawrence was killed. 

 The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is moving to the West End in May. 

 At many points in the lengthy proceedings, police witnesses including Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, turned aside all references to the existence of institutional racism on the force, the very characterization they are now being told they must embrace. 

 The official originally in charge of the Lawrence investigation, deputy assistant police commissioner David Osland, said at the time, ``The suggestion that any police officer would investigate a murder less competently because the victim was black is an absolute disgrace.'' 

 At the outset of the hearings, Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, and others pursuing the case protested the choice of Macpherson as chairman, saying he was insensitive to their needs and perspectives. But on Monday there was praise and expression of some astonishment at his conclusions. 

 Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, said that Sir William had ``managed to grasp the nettle'' of Britain's race relations. ``Our expectations were low, but if they had been higher, this is the sort of thing we should have expected,'' he said. 

 Lee Jasper, director the black policy group The 1990 Trust, said: ``We are very pleased. The report is full-blooded in its criticism, and it does reflect, as far as we can see, the broad concerns of the black community.'' 

 Ros Howells, a friend of the Lawrences, suggested that Sir William had had his views changed dramatically by the evasive testimony of police officers, which in their current staged retelling, draw gasps of disbelief from theatergoers. ``He was shocked during the inquiry by the incompetence of the police,'' she said. 

 The government, which has received praise from backers of the Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public on Wednesday. 

 Home Secretary Jack Straw obtained a judicial order on Saturday night forcing The Sunday Telegraph to drop an exclusive account of the report in its early editions, then had to back down when other papers protested the move.
