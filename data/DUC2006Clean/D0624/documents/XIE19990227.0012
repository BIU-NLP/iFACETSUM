LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government rejected Calls on Friday for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case. 

 Home Office minister Paul Boateng denied that Straw or his officials were to blame for the publication of witnesses' names and addresses in appendices to the report on the police investigation of the racist murder. 

 He told MPs that the chairman of the inquiry team, Sir William Macpherson, had accepted full responsibility for the blunder. 

 "This is not a matter that cannot be put at the door of the Home Office," he said. 

 Several of the named informants are now under police protection after their names were made public and the opposition Conservative party MPs have called Straw to resign for the error. 

 Distribution of the report has been suspended and fresh copies are to be published without the offending details. 

 Both Labor and opposition MPs expressed incredulity that the Home Office did not remove the names from the document when it received the report more than a week prior to publication.
