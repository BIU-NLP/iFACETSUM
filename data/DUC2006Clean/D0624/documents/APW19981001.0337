LONDON (AP) _ The chief of Britain's largest police force apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations between police and minorities. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him. ``I deeply regret that we have not brought Stephen's racist murderers to justice and I would like to personally apologize again today to Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence for our failures,'' Condon said, from his seat a few feet away from Neville and Doreen Lawrence at a public inquiry into the case. ``We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a central concern is that the Met is racist. I acknowledge that we have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment,'' he added. Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus stop by a group of white attackers. The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and incompetently in resolving the case. Two men were charged, but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the case. A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law, also collapsed. The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign. (mb-kg)
