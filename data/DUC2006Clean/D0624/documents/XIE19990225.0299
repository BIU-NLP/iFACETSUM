LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw unveiled new curbs Wednesday to combat police racism in the country after a damning report on ther murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. 

 Straw told the parliament that he had ordered an immediate inspection of the London Metropolitan police force by the Inspectorate of Constabulary. 

 The report into the racist murder of Lawrence which was released earlier in the day labeled London's police force "institutionally racist" and condemned officers for "fundamental errors." 

 Straw's response to the report followed Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise Wednesday afternoon during the Prime Minister's Questions of a "fundamental shift in the way British society deals with racism." 

 "The publication of today's report on the killing of Stephen Lawrence is a very important day in the history of our country," Blair said. 

 "It will certainly lead to new laws but more than that it will bring a new era of race relations," he added. 

 In his announcement, the home secretary said the Race Relations Act would be extended to cover the police -- one of the report's 70 recommendations. 

 Straw also said he had asked the Law Commission to consider giving the Court of Appeal powers to permit prosecution after acquittal new, viable evidence was presented. 

 But he lent his backing to Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Paul Condon to remain in his job. Condon has admitted the report had brought "shame" on his force, but he refused to resign. 

 Stephen, 18, was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in southeast London in 1993. Nobody has been convicted of the murder so far.
