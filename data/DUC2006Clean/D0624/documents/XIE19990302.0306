LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in England and Wales were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a government inspector's report said on Monday. 

 The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted "institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. 

 "There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20 recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago. 

 Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week. 

 The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by white youths in 1993. No-one has been convicted of the crime. 

 After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing methods. 

 Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are brought under the Race Relations Act. 

 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon has revealed plans to introduce tests for racism as well as launching a major study of what the public look for from the police.
