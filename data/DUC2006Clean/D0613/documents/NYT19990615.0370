AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Generation X consumers prefer compact and premium midsize vehicles, with their No. 1 choice being the Honda Civic, according to a report released Tuesday by Agoura Hills-based J.D. Power and Associates. 

 But that 20- to 34-year-old group is a highly fragmented lot and, thus, a tough bunch to market to _ which is something carmakers are going to have to learn to do, as this group is expected to constitute one-quarter to one-third of the car-buying public by 2005, the study said. 

 Also, the study found that older Gen-Xers rely on the Internet to obtain information before buying a car much more frequently than do 20- to 24-year-olds, who have less access to the Internet, are first-time buyers and tend to turn to family and friends for input. 

 ``One other interesting finding is that Generation X is more willing to stretch its income to buy a vehicle,'' said Sara Wong Hilton, manager of market analysis at Power's Detroit office, who led the study. 

 Gen-Xers will pay about 46 percent of their annual household income on a new vehicle, vs. 35 percent for baby boomers. 

 Lynda Sakamaki-Smith, spokeswoman for American Honda Motor Co. Inc., said she wasn't surprised to hear that Honda models are among Gen-Xers' favorites. The company has sold 129,531 1999 Civics through May, and the median age is 28 for the sportier coupe model. 

 About half the Civic buyers are single; 46.5 percent are male, 53.5 percent are female; and 55 percent are college graduates or higher, spokeswoman Sakamaki-Smith said. 

 ``This Generation X group sees (the Civic's) potential for fun, but it's reliable at the same time,'' she said.
