FORT WORTH, Texas _ We can assume that the Rev. Edgar Helms of Boston _ who, in 1910, founded what would become Goodwill Industries _ was not hip. Neither was the good reverend, most likely, groovy. He certainly didn't know that gray would become the new black. 

 Nonetheless, hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has come to consider the retail stores. Due in part to Generation X's preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s (and '80s and even early '90s, it seems) and thanks to image-building efforts from the organization itself, Goodwill isn't just for people with ``special needs'' anymore. 

 ``I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool,'' says local twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe. ``I've been going there for about a decade. My shopping technique, wherever I've lived, is to find the poorest neighborhood and to go there. You avoid places where hipsters go because they'll sift through everything and get the good stuff. They won't go to the poor neighborhood.'' 

 Like most Goodwillers, McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite find. ``It was an early '70s-era purple, shiny three-piece suit, with, like, huge lapels. It had a sheen to it,'' he says. ``I paid about $1.50 or $2. But I gave it to a friend because it looked better on him. He had an Afro.'' 

 McCabe does admit to having ``special needs,'' but not the sort that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century. The nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund community-based training and job-placement programs for people who otherwise might slip through the cracks. Last year, Goodwill Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job placement and sold nearly $690 million in donated goods. 

 Erin Quillian, the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of Fort Worth, says her organization got its groove back by focusing on retail display in the stores. 

 ``I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image and the way we present ourselves,'' she says. ``We're not what people typically think a thrift store is. It's surprising to a lot of people, when they first come in, that we look just like any other store.'' 

 Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit store managers who have retail experience, people who ``really know how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it.'' Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard's before coming to Goodwill. 

 But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its well-displayed racks, but that the decidedly downscale shop founded by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale fashion. Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design firm William Reid. 

 William Reid's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley Korshak, Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue. Reid is so hip that sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good idea. And, as it turns out, he shops Goodwill for inspiration. 

 ``It's almost like a fashion library,'' Reid says. ``I go in there just looking for things that are very unusual, whether it's details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you can't explain to someone. We find a lot of old ties, and we'll take a pattern of that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit and make it into shirts and all sorts of things.'' 

 In fact, Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy. Only a few weeks ago, he bought a jacket for $15. 

 ``It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around the cuff,'' he remembers fondly. ``It was so unusual. We immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said, `How difficult is it to do this?' They laughed and said they couldn't touch it. The machinery to do some of those things just isn't around anymore.''
