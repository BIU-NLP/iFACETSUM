&UR;  &LR; Tom Beaudoin is not your typical theologian engaged in esoteric explications of ancient religious texts. 

 Instead, he uses MTV as a research lab. He studies tattoos and body piercing as expressions of spirituality. And he's also in a rock band made up of other theologians. 

 Beaudoin, 29, is a self-described Generation Xer, that amorphous population cohort born in the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. Beaudoin wants to be their theologian. He believes that Generation X _ contrary to popular perception _ is deeply spiritual, if not necessarily devout. 

 You just need to look at their taste in music, movies, and dress, says Beaudoin, a PhD candidate at Boston College. He makes his case in a new book, ``Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X.'' 

 It isn't that Generation X isn't interested in religion, Beaudoin argues. It's simply that its members are looking for a religion they can believe in. And what GenXers are after can't easily be found within the four walls and under the steeple of the local church. 

 To understand the spirituality of Generation X you have to look at popular culture, particularly media culture. There has never been another generation, Beaudoin says, so intimately linked to media culture _ the Internet, television, film, and music. 

 ``Pop culture is our amniotic fluid; it's where we find meaning in our life,'' says Beaudoin, a Roman Catholic who strayed from the faith for a few years before becoming convinced that the church's tradition and teachings can appeal to people in his generation. 

 Sitting in his Somerville apartment, overflowing with books and CDs, he ticks off examples of spiritual or religious themes he sees in contemporary youth culture. 

 There are strong religious or spiritual undercurrents in recent albums by artists ranging from U2 to Sarah McLachlan to Puff Daddy. Religious messages are also sprinkled more frequently in movies, for example, in ``Contact,'' ``Chasing Amy,'' and even ``Titanic.'' 

 The Dalai Lama has become hugely popular among young people, not just because he is a stirring champion of human rights, but because people are drawn to his Tibetan Buddhist teachings as a way of coping with life's stresses. 

 Harvey Cox, a renowned professor at Harvard Divinity School where Beaudoin received a master's degree, said at first blush it might seem foolish to suggest that Generation X is interested in spiritual meaning. But, in a forward to Beaudoin's book, Cox says his former student might be on to something. 

 ``Here is a generation that stays away from most churches in droves but loves songs about God and Jesus, a generation that would score very low on any standard piety scale but at times seems almost obsessed with saints, visions, and icons in all shapes and sizes,'' Cox writes. 

 ``These are the young people who, styrofoam cups of cappuccino in hand, crowd around the shelves of New Age spirituality titles in the local book market and post thousands of religious and quasi-religion notes on the bulletin boards in cyberspace.'' 

 And, Beaudoin and Cox both note that Pope John Paul II enjoys a strong following among people in the Generation X population. Last summer, even the Vatican was stunned when more than a million young people turned out to help John Paul celebrate World Youth Day in Paris. 

 Beaudoin, in his book, identifies several themes that underpin the ``theology'' of Generation X. First is a deep suspicion of institutions, including organized religion. Second is the importance of having a personal spiritual experience. 

 Beaudoin says the Catholic Church, in its liturgy, must do a better job of ``giving people a powerful experience of the Holy Spirit, which is the only way people will realize there is something at stake to being Catholic.'' 

 A third theme among Generation Xers is a belief that suffering can be a redemptive, spiritual experience. Finally, Generation Xers believe ambiguity is a central part of faith. Rather than fearing uncertainty, Beaudoin says, Generation Xers embrace it. 

 Beaudoin has started a Catholic ministry aimed at people in Generation X at the Paulist Center in downtown Boston. ``GenXers are hungry for spirituality and the challenge is to find the most effective means of satisfying that hunger,'' he said.

 A Vatican envoy has recently visited Iraq, reportedly to discuss the possibility of adding that nation to a possible millennium tour of the Holy Land by Pope John Paul II. The Iraqi town of Ur is the traditional home of the prophet Abraham before he set out with his family for the biblical land of Canaan. Abraham is revered by Christians, Jews, and Muslims. 

 The tour would include stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestinian self-rule territories.
