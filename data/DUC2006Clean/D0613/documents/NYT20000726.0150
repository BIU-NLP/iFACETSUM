Gen Xers are looking for something _ or someone _ to nurture and love. For some, it will be a baby, for others, it will be a pet or even a pet-like toy. 

 From Main Street to Hollywood, babies are ``in.'' 

 Pregnant Annette Bening was the darling of the Oscars. Jada Pinkett consistently shows up scantily clad and well rounded. While in years past, Reese Witherspoon might have lost her star appeal by getting pregnant so young (and, oh my, out of wedlock), today's trendsetters consider her inspirational _ someone who has it all and is able to balance a family and a career. 

 Indeed, it's another Baby Boom, spurred by a good economy. Babies are expensive, but Xers say they can afford them. Also, many women are beginning to think that maybe their most important role is not in the boardroom. 

 We've been seeing signs of this for a while now. Much of this trend stems from a return to more traditional values such as mom in the kitchen baking an apple pie for her brood. 

 One fourth of the respondents in Youth Intelligence's most recent study of 14- to 30-year-olds listed ``staying home to raise children'' as a sign of success. And according to a recent study by the Families and Work Institute in New York City, high schoolers overwhelmingly said they wanted to land jobs that gave them time for family activities. Behind this attitude was the fact that the majority were children of working parents and they wanted to make sure their own children came first. 

 But lest feminists fear that this generation is destroying all of their hard work, understand that this trend is not simply about going back to the values and customs of the '50s. Rather, it's about Xers recognizing that it's difficult to be a good parent and that raising a teen in today's world may be harder than ever before. 

 Even though the ``stay-at-home'' parent of choice continues to be the woman, many of the male trendsetters surveyed by Youth Intelligence suggested that if the mother of their children had a better job than they did, they would stay home themselves. They are just as disenchanted with the workplace as women and are even jealous of the bond a mother has with her baby. 

 As for women, a recent NBC News poll showed that only 14 percent of women claim to work for ``personal fulfillment'' (the rest work for financial reasons), and a study Youth Intelligence conducted for Cosmopolitan magazine revealed that 68 percent of women stated that they would stay home if they could afford to. 

 Having several children is also deemed a sign of success. As a 28-year-old in New York explained, ``People are over the big houses or fancy cars. These days it's the number of children you have Everyone knows how expensive it is to raise kids, so having more than two means you're well off And I think a woman staying home is a source of pride for a lot of men who feel proud that their wife doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to.'' 

 The pride factor aside, you don't have to be a parent to express your need to nurture. It's no longer unusual to see a puppy carried around in a baby papoose or brought to the office and tucked happily in the corner. And is it just me, or is the Aibo Robodog the most endearing character in this season's cast of MTV's ``The Real World''? From plastic Tamagotchis to puppies galore, everyone wants something to care for. 

 A 28-year-old in Los Angeles summed it up by saying, ``I think it's just a really hard world. People have to be tough and on their guard so much, but you need an outlet And finding a person to love is a lot harder than finding a pet to love.'' 

 Indeed, the need to nurture seems to extend to friends as well as canines, with trendsetters citing extreme devotion to their peers. As one 17-year-old told us, ``I think teenagers today really take care of each other. Not everyone has good parents, or their parents are working or whatever, so you really take care of your friends and support them.'' 

 So, look for signs of caring all around you. Maybe we really are becoming a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
