DAYTON, Ohio _ When scores of the state's behind-the-scenes politicos showed up in Columbus last month to schmooze at the annual Ohio Board of Elections Association conference, the Montgomery County contingent stood out like a Brownie troop at a senior citizens ball. 

 ``We would go into these hospitality suites and people would look at us and say, `What's going on in Montgomery County? These people are so young,' '' said Nan Whaley, who at age 24 is both executive director of the county's Democratic Party and a member of the local Board of Elections. 

 Joining Whaley at the convention was her mirror image in Montgomery County politics _ 27-year-old John Shaw, the executive director of the local Republican Party _ who, like Whaley, holds a patronage job as a member of the election board. 

 Supporting the two young party execs is a growing cadre of 20-something and early 30-something political workers who are giving the lie _ at least in the Dayton area _ to the notion that Generation X is a bunch of slackers who would rather whine about societal problems than fix them. 

 The youth infusion has meant ``more pep and vigor in the party in the last three to four years than in a long time,'' said James E.P. ``Sully'' Sullivan, 79, a longtime local Democratic Party player and a former director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections. 

 In typical partisan fashion, the two parties each claim to be the Pied Piper of the local youth movement. 

 ``We have about 100 Young Democrats in Montgomery County. They have three Young Republicans,'' Whaley sniffed. ``There is no organized Young Republicans in Montgomery County.'' 

 Shaw begged to differ. The Democrats ``may have a stronger organization, but we have just as many strong young people'' in the local Republican ranks. ``Just going to club meetings doesn't mean you're active.'' 

 RECRUITING THE YOUNG 

 Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman said he got the ball rolling across the generations here in 1996, soon after the overthrow of former chairman Joe Shump and the old Democratic guard, by resurrecting the College Democrats Club at the University of Dayton. The club's growing membership was then invited to join the county Young Democrats and put to work within the local party structure. 

 ``Word got out that we cared about young people and that we tried to get them involved in things,'' Lieberman said. ``As a result, we got lucky and ended up with some very good young people.'' 

 The list includes Whaley; Charlie Bowling, 29, who helped rebuild the Young Democrat organization here; Troy Singer, 34, who ran Tony Hill's top vote-getting campaign last fall for the Dayton school board; and Hill himself, 31, who started out as an adviser to U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, R-Dayton. 

 Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party, says local Republicans have done their own trolling for youth, primarily by changing the way the party recruits and promotes its workers. 

 It's no longer who you know, or how long you've paid party dues, Jacobson said. Now it's what you know. 

 ``We started recruiting young people right out of college that we think have talent,'' he said. 

 The Republican kiddie list now includes Shaw; Chris Heizer, 27, director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections and vice president of the local Republican Party executive committee; Doug Tully, 29, supervisor of the Board of Elections and a member of the local Republican committee; and Jon Husted, 32, who is running for the 41st District seat in the Ohio House of Representatives being vacated by J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton. 

 FROM ENVELOPE-STUFFING TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 

 Interestingly, while the Democrats tend to talk about the youthful vision and energy that Generation X has brought to party politics, Republicans are more likely to tout their technical and organizational skills. 

 Menial tasks such as typing addresses, stuffing envelopes and tallying votes used to be the drudgery that greased the political machine, They were often assigned to armies of senior citizens with plenty of time on their hands. 

 Now it's all done by computer. 

 ``So we get bright young people who can take apart a computer and put it back together again,'' said Susan Finley, co-chair of the Montgomery County Republican Party who also sits on the Board of Elections. At age 68, Finley calls herself the ``house mother'' of the local election board. 

 Susan Mitchell, author of ``Generation X: The Young Adult Market'' (New Strategist, $69.95), said it's unusual for Dayton to have so many young people involved in local politics, especially party politics. ``The thing that is most striking about this generation is that they tend not to identify with any political party,'' she said. 

 The young pols in both parties worry that too many of their peers continue to be alienated from the political process. 

 ``I think it's just immaturity,'' Singer said. ``As we grow older, we become more aware of how people in office can affect our paychecks because of taxes that are taken out, how they can affect the economy and jobs that are available.'' 

 Kate Evans, a 19-year-old member of UD's Young Democrats, says many of her classmates are apathetic about the political scene because they are confident that good jobs are waiting for them after graduation. 

 ``I think a lot of people my age feel very comfortable, almost complacent,'' Evans said. ``But how long is this (prosperity) going to last?'' 

 Whaley says that for many Gen-Xers, the bad times are already here, but younger voters aren't getting the message. ``Most of my generation is underemployed and don't have good (employee) benefits. But they don't equate that with the ballot box.'' 

 POLITICS OFTEN RUNS IN THE BLOOD 

 The Gen-Xers involved in local politics most often credited their families for their interest in political careers. 

 Whaley cites the inspiration of her mother, who also was active as a Young Democrat and who later ran for a number of local and state offices in Indiana, including state auditor. Her mother most recently won election as clerk-treasurer of Mooresville, Ind., in 1996. 

 Singer's uncle, Enos Singer, was a past president of the Ohio Board of Elections Association and a longtime veteran of statehouse politics. His grandfather, Kenneth Singer, was a trustee for many years in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio. 

 For others, national leaders provided the inspiration to enter politics. ``My first interest started with Ronald Reagan . . . because he made us proud to be Americans again,'' Shaw said. ``I've been reading presidential biographies ever since.'' 

 Both the Democrat and Republican youth squads concurred that Montgomery County's evenly divided vote, and often hotly contested races, is the challenge that drew them into local party politics. 

 ``Young people have plenty of opportunities to work in Columbus or (Washington) D.C., but Dayton is fun,'' Whaley said. ``It's the number one swing county (for elections) in the state. Every race is a real fight here. People can win on 400 votes out of 50,000 cast.'' 

 Shaw agreed. ``It's an exciting county. Franklin and Hamilton are mostly Republican. Toledo and Cleveland are mostly Democrat. But this is just a good 50/50 county with a lot of contested races.'' 

 They may teasingly call each other R's and D's, but the young politicos here insist the rivalry only brings them closer socially. 

 On election night last year, the kiddie corps from both parties went out to celebrate together. ``Do we argue? Oh yeah,'' Shaw said. ``But it's all in fun. Nobody ever gets upset about it because we all know where everybody is coming from before we get there.'' 

 If Gen-Xers shy away from politics, Shaw puts at least part of the blame on the system itself. ``I think, frankly, they want to see more candidates their own age to relate to,'' he said. 

 `I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH WAS' 

 So far, most of the young pols here have been content to work behind the scenes as campaign workers, strategists and committee members. But many are itching to run for office and some, like 31-year-old Tony Hill, already have. 

 After serving for several years as a campaign worker for other local candidates, Hill ran for Dayton school board last fall and nabbed the most votes in the race. 

 ``I didn't want to be one of those who just complained about things going wrong,'' he said. ``I kind of put my money where my mouth was.'' 

 Too often, the younger generation is blamed for not being engaged in politics ``when the real problem is that the political system has failed to engage them,'' said Gen-X expert Mitchell. 

 ``Older people do things out of a civic obligation _ you vote because you're supposed to,'' she said. ``But younger people aren't going to vote because of that. You have to give them something to vote for, give them something to get excited about.'' 

 Term limits may help create some of that excitement in the statehouse. 

 ``You don't have to be there for 10 years before getting into a position of standing, because everyone is limited to eight years anyway,'' said Husted, citing one of the reasons he decided to run for Mottley's vacated seat. 

 Hill said political leaders can't wait too long before unleashing other Gen-X candidates, or they'll lose young voters completely. 

 ``I think it's time to start looking at our generation _ not just on the school board, but to serve downtown on the (city) commission and in the statehouse as well,'' he said. ``I think we have some outstanding young people in the city. We need to make sure we're growing these people for elections down the road.''
