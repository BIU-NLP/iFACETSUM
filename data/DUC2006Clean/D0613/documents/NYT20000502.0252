Service &LR;  &QC;  &QL; SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Seven years ago three guys named Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu got together over beers at a Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America. 

 The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine families, were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking habits of their own generation. The common wisdom was that members of so-called Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to be elitist, boring and passe. 

 The beers kept flowing and the conversation became more impassioned _ after all, family fortunes and life styles were at stake. The grape heirs decided they had to do something to make wine cool for the cyber generation or else the party could be over. 

 The Wine Brats, now a national movement with 16,000 members, was born following that sudsy night of brainstorming. 

 In the beginning, the Wine Brats was just the three young men armed with an ambitious goal: to knock wine off its lofty pedestal. The idea was to make wine fun, accessible and relevant to a generation skeptical of glitz, glamour and glad-handing sales pitches. Their mantra was ``Wine for the People.'' 

 ``Our message was, wine doesn't have to be pretentious,'' said Wine Brat Jeff Bundschu, 31, a sixth-generation Sonoma Valley vintner who is now general manager of his family's Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Vineburg. ``You don't have to drink it out of crystal glasses and it can fit into your lifestyle and, by the way, it goes great with pizza and burgers.'' 

 Bundschu teamed with childhood pals Mike Sangiacomo, 31, of Sangiacomo Vineyards, and Jon Sebastiani, 29, of Viansa Winery, to found the Wine Brats in 1993. The name fit. Growing up, they and other privileged children of wealthy winemakers were fondly called wine brats by their families and members of the community. 

 The trendy group created an energy of its own, spreading like morning glory in a vineyard. Wine Brats now has 45 chapters throughout the country, with Chicago and New York leading Brat enclaves. 

 Brats converge at wine raves where cabernet and merlot are savoured in a multimedia blowouts with art, music, food and technology. They attend seminars on how to pair wine with popcorn, corn chips and salsa while big screen television sets play reruns of ``Happy Days.'' 

 From its humble beginnings in the Sonoma pub, Wine Brats has become an Internet-based collective of young wine enthusiasts, with the organization's core age group 24 to 36. 

 They have even written a book: ``The Wine Brats' Guide to Living With Wine,'' published by St. Martin's Griffin of New York. 

 The original Wine Brats are now older than many of the members who have jumped on their fast-moving wine train. They also are busier than they were seven years ago when all three were single, footloose and just embarking on careers at family wineries and vineyards. 

 Today, all three Wine Brats are married, and Bundschu and Sangiacomo each have a child. All say their family obligations and wine jobs are demanding, limiting the time they have to raid Gen X hangouts to pour pinot noir. 

 ``I'm finding it extremely difficult to juggle my personal life and my professional role at Viansa. The last few years have been very busy,'' said Sebastiani, who is now president of Viansa Winery, the winery and Italian marketplace owned by his parents, Sam and Vicki Sebastiani. 

 Mike Sangiacomo is now the ranch manager at his family's Sangiacomo Vineyards, one of Sonoma County's premier grape producers. 

 Most of the Wine Brats' 16,000 members are young, affluent urban consumers wired to the Web. They prefer high-energy parties _ rather than sedate sippings _ to sample wine. 

 ``One of the things we've always stressed is that wine is an agricultural product,'' said Bundschu. ``It comes from the earth and is dependent on weather. It's real, healthy and doesn't have to be complicated.'' That goes hand-in-hand with young peoples' demand for simplicity, intelligence and a healthy nonchalance. 

 Wine Brats does not want people to increase their alcohol consumption, just their beverage of choice. The group's motto is: ``Drink less, drink better.'' 

 Although Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu remain on the Wine Brats' board of directors, they are not as involved as they were in the early days. The other two members of the Wine Brats' board of directors are Dawn Dooley, formerly of Duckhorn Vineyards in the Napa Valley and now with Hedges Cellars in Washington, and Mimi Gatens of Vine Cliff Winery in Napa. 

 The Wine Brats directors hold board meetings via e-mail. The organization's day-to-day operation is done by a paid staff headed by executive director Joel Quigley, who has held the position since 1995. 

 Quigley, 38, uses the Internet and his staff's youthful energy to spread the word about wine and build membership. Working with Quigley out of the Wine Brats' Santa Rosa office are six full-time staff members and seven interns from the wine business program at Sonoma State University. 

 Wine Brats has become a think tank for the wine industry, he said, evaluating trends and assessing wine's place in changing lifestyles. ``We have no constraints, which allows us to think outside the box and run with our ideas,'' Quigley said. 

 Technically, Wine Brats is an acronym _ Wine to Benefit Responsible Adults for Tomorrow's Society _ but few people, even the Brats themselves, ever use it. 

 More than 50 wineries and wine industry groups contribute to the Wine Brats budget, which this year is approaching $1 million. The Wine Institute, a trade group based in San Francisco, provided $10,000 in seed money to launch the Wine Brats. 

 ``If our mission is to convert the unconverted, then television and mainstream media are where we have to be seen,'' said Sebastiani. ``Young adults who don't drink wine, don't read wine publications. It's that simple.'' 

 Quigley and the Wine Brats have ambitious plans, dreaming of new venues, bigger crowds and greater influence. There are still many tequila drinkers to convert to the joys of cabernet and zinfandel, Quigley said. 

 ``We're not stopping,'' said Sebastiani, ``until Dennis Rodman is sucking down chardonnay.''
