STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet. 

 Hammerman, who leads Stamford's conservative Jewish congregation, Temple Beth El, tried a search by typing in ''God.'' 

 The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking God in Cyberspace.'' 

 Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the Internet to find faith. He's concluded that younger generations are not rejecting God but understanding him in a different way. 

 ''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,'' Hammerman said. 

 While many young people don't set foot in a church, synagogue or mosque, they may be more likely to discuss religion in a chat room or surf for Web sites where they can learn about different religions. 

 ''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,'' Hammerman said. 

 Instead, people are identifying God with the concept of the World Wide Web, ''that God seems to be within and between us, rather than above us.'' 

 A recent survey found that 75 percent of Internet users have engaged Web searches with religious themes. 

 The Internet is sometimes viewed as an alienating force, driving surfers into an artificial world and away from real human contact. 

 Hammerman, unlike many mainstream religious leaders, views the Internet as a vessel for improved communication between people, with the power to ''connect us in ways we've never seen before.'' 

 Some churches and congregations, including Hammerman's, have Web sites. In the future, prayer services will probably be available online, too, he said. 

 Hammerman has even married a couple who met on the Internet. 

 ''I think there is something real happening in the virtual world,'' he said. ''The word 'religion,' in Latin, actually means 'reconnect.' '' 

 The book is supplemented by a Web site, aptly addressed, thelordismyshepherd.com, where surfers can read about the book and discuss it. 

 Hammerman, 43, has led Temple Beth El for 13 years. He was formerly the first pulpit rabbi to be president of The Council of Churches & Synagogues of Southwestern Connecticut.
