VIENNA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China today put forward proposals for organized transnational crime and international exchange and cooperation to be included in the priorities of a U.N. anti-crime commission. 

 Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice. 

 The 10-day meeting has been called to assess and redefine the priorities of the CCPCJ. 

 Zhang, the Chinese vice minister of justice, also proposed that drug trafficking, juvenile delinquency and economic crime should be included in CCPCJ's priorities.
