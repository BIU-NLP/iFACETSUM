HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong crime boss who reportedly has admitted to participating in the kidnapping of two of the territory's wealthiest businessmen also claims he had plans to kidnap more, a newspaper said Friday. The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao said that Cheung Tze-keung, whose alias is ``Big Spender,'' told a Chinese court that he was the only person who had the ability to kidnap a tycoon in Hong Kong. The newspaper quoted Cheung as saying during his trial in China that ``had I not been arrested ... there would have been no way that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the gang's kidnapping spree. The trial of Cheung and 35 other defendants in Guangzhou, southern China, is closed to journalists, and Ming Pao did not say how it obtained its information. Charges against the reputed gangsters center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S. dlrs 48,300). Some media reports have said Cheung had already admitted to planning and participating in the kidnapping of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties. But the Hong Kong Standard reported Friday that Cheung was trying to pin the blame for masterminding the kidnapping of one businessman, identified only by the surname ``Li,'' on one of Cheung's purported henchmen, Chan Chi-ho. Chan was described by the Standard as a professional criminal who got 290 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 37 million) in the tycoon's kidnapping. The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to assassinate the defendants to silence them. The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security officials. Ming Pao said two bomb threats have been delivered since the trial began, with the second on Thursday allegedly signed by someone claiming to be a Cheung accomplice.
