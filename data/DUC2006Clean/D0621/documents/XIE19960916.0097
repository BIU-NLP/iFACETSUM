BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Five leaders of three hooligan gangs have been executed in China, Liu Jiachen, vice president of the country's Supreme People's Court, announced today. 

 The executions were carried out in Shangqiu of central China's Henan Province, in Nanping of east China's Fujian Province and in Xianyang of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, yesterday and today. 

 The five criminals were sentenced to death for committing such serious crimes as hooliganism, killing, theft and harming individuals. 

 "Some hooligan gangs are well organized, having some characteristics of sinister gangs of the underworld, which are doing serious harm to society. It will be the focus of the crackdown against crimes in the next stage," Liu said. 

 The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times. 

 Usually they have the characteristics of large gang members, active in large areas, committing crimes frequently and doing serious harm to society, said Liu. 

 China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on wiping out those endangering social security and public order. The crackdown against serious crime since April has effectively contained criminal activities and won widespread support from people.
