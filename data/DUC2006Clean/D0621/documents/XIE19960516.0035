BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have solved a significant number of cases involving major criminal offenses, since the start of a nationwide anti-crime campaign on April 28. 

 These included apprehending six people who were on the Public Security Ministry's most-wanted list, arresting some escaped criminals, and confiscating a large number of illegal firearms. 

 In other developments, police in east China's Fujian Province have cracked a kidnapping case that involved a Chinese-American gang and one from Hong Kong, and a total of 1.3 million yuan (some 160,000 U.S. dollars). 

 Police in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces joined hands in work on a drug smuggling case that involved a total of 600 kg of heroin. Thirty-nine drug traffickers were arrested and ten vehicles used to ferry the drugs were seized. 

 In central China's Hunan Province, an eight-member gang of thieves who were connected with 141 thefts involving 370,000 yuan-worth of stolen articles, has been put out. 

 Police in northeast China's Liaoning Province arrested a person who had killed and wounded three victims and been at large for ten years. 

 Attempts to stop the manufacture and sale of firearms have been increased because of the obvious harm to society. 

 In east and northeast China's Shandong, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces, more than 8,000 illegal firearms have been confiscated in each of the provinces, and the numbers for Hebei, Hubei and Shanxi provinces are more than 3,000 each. 

 A number of criminals have voluntarily surrendered to police as well. Over 600 escapees had given themselves up in central China's Henan Province, by May 6, and the number for Hunan Province stood at 490. 

 A senior police official attributes these achievements in the nationwide crackdown on major crimes to the positive attitude and participation of ordinary citizens everywhere. 

 Over the past two weeks, 80 percent of the criminal cases cracked in east China's Shandong Province, in fact, were the result of tips provided by citizens, and 45 percent of the criminal arrests came about because of help from the people. 

 A high-ranking official pointed out recently that government at all levels should take this opportunity to improve rules and regulations, management, and precautionary measures in order to make the social order much better.
