The recent internal shake-up inside judiciaries and their efforts to ensure justice have also been fruitful, and have won applause from the public, Cao said. 

 However, the present security situation is still "rather serious," legislators said. 

 They said criminal rates are rising; the problems of murder, robbery, explosion, thefts are prominent; prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police raids; gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are sharply increasing. 

 Chinese police have intensified their fights against criminal gangs and smashed many since 1996, but the public have reported that such gangs are still spreading in number and influence, they said. 

 According to statistics, 60 percent of suspected criminals landing in the hands of police are now minors. 

 Inspection teams also proposed several solutions for the worsening situation. They are: 

 -- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising crime rates; 

 -- The community-level security network must be spread and instituted all across the country, because surveys have found those places with poor security are also lax in enforcing this system; 

 -- And, most importantly, leaders at all levels must first realize the present situation and never slacken their work of comprehensive management of public security.
