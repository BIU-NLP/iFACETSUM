HONG KONG (AP) _ Law enforcement officers staged about two dozen raids and arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in connection with a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday. The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender.'' Hong Kong police were alerted when an unidentified man approached them saying his cousin _ who had sneaked into Hong Kong from China _ was being held for ransom by the gang, Radio Hong Kong said. The report quoted Chief Inspector Lam Nam-wing as saying 85 officers were mobilized early Wednesday to search 23 addresses and two safety deposit boxes. Among those arrested by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong police was Cheung's wife, who was in one of the houses raided, Television Broadcast reported. Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery. The gang allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom. Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets of 17 relatives of Cheung. More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles are restrained under the order. Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 25,740) during the raids. The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police _ some of them illegal immigrants _ are still being detained for questioning. Although no official information was ever released on the kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies. Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong. In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8 million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan (U.S. dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese state media.
