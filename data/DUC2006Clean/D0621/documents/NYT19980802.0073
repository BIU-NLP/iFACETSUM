GUANGZHOU, China _ On a back street in this mangy city, where thick steam bubbles off woks at outdoor food stalls and mah-jongg tiles can be heard clacking late into the evening, a gang of Hong Kong mobsters often met in a well-guarded house to plot their most lucrative capers. 

 The gang got its start years ago by robbing jewelry stores in Hong Kong, then retreating across the Chinese border to hide here because the local police were either too inept or corrupt to care. The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom. 

 The gang's leader, known as ``Big Spender'' for his habit of dropping a million dollars a shot at a favorite casino in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macau, seemed to typify the excesses of organized crime that flourished in southern China in step with an economic boom in the 1990s. Big Spender, whose real name is Cheung Tze-keung, may have been the most wanted man in Hong Kong, but in this part of China he became a folk hero for his apparent invincibility. 

 Last week, after a series of brazen robberies, murders and kidnappings, Cheung's gang was officially pronounced dead. China's national police seized 32 people they described as his accomplices. They also seized nearly $5 million in cash, 11 luxury cars and a cache of explosives and firearms. 

 Cheung was not only in custody, police said, but had confessed to the gang's role in murder, robbery, kidnapping and smuggling explosives. What Cheung actually said, and how he pleads, will probably remain as secret as other case files in China. 

 The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious evolution of lawlessness that straddles the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong province, an area with a rich history of secret societies, pirates and criminal intrigue. 

 Perhaps it is a sign that Asia's mounting economic woes are hurting criminals, too. More likely, it is a kind of poetic justice for a singularly talented gangster and his crew, who had a remarkably long run before getting caught. 

 For years, Cheung took advantage of the wide cracks that exist between distinctly separate law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong and Guangdong, which have long mistrusted each other's methods and principles. 

 Bouncing back and forth over the border as it suited him, Cheung was able to capitalize on the poor communication between police on each side. Even since Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule last year, cooperation between the police forces has been limited. 

 Now, however, the tables have turned on Cheung. This time he is likely to fare worse from the cross-border confusion, not better. 

 Ordinarily, Hong Kong police ask for the return of a Hong Kong citizen who commits crimes in Hong Kong but is arrested in Guangdong. 

 But this time, Hong Kong police have raised no objection to seeing Cheung's case handled in Guangdong, where being charged is a virtual guarantee of being found guilty and where the penalty for any serious violent crime is usually a swift execution. Were Cheung to be tried in Hong Kong, he would have at least have a chance at acquittal, a trick he pulled off once before on an armed robbery charge. 

 Zhang Xingfeng, director of the criminal investigation bureau of Beijing's Ministry of Public Security, said Cheung's major crimes were planned in Guangzhou, so his case will be handled by the Guangdong provincial authorities. Many of the plans were made, Zhang said, in one of 50 properties owned by Cheung and his gang. 

 In addition to murder and kidnapping, Zhang also said, the gang had smuggled more than 1,500 pounds of explosives from Guangdong into Hong Kong. 

 Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said. Just over half were arrested here on July 22; the rest were apprehended on July 29. 

 ``All of the arrests were made in the mainland after six months of investigations carried out with the support and cooperation of the Hong Kong police,'' Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing. 

 Yet Cheung himself was actually apprehended in January, after a tip from an informer led police into a long cat-and-mouse chase that ended in Jiangmen, a city south of here, where Cheung was caught trying to escape in a taxi cab. 

 Hardly the image of the hard-nosed, tough-jawed outlaw that dominates a popular genre of Hong Kong gangster movies, Cheung is a slight man with a gently protruding forehead. 

 Apparently enjoying the image of fancy cars and fast women that comes with his territory, Cheung reveled in his aura of invincibility in 1995, when Hong Kong's High Court acquitted him on a technicality from an earlier conviction for armed robbery of an armored truck at Kai Tak Airport. 

 He had served 18 months in prison, apparently leaving him with such serious grievances against the prison authorities that his gang was suspected when a bulldozer suddenly demolished a prison guard house one night. The next month, the home of Hong Kong's secretary for security was fire-bombed. 

 Hong Kong newspapers also reported that Cheung was behind a bizarre plan to kidnap Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, as a way to win the release of a fellow gangster, Yip Kai-foon. The plan was apparently foiled. 

 Of all the gang's crimes, the most astonishing one was undoubtedly the kidnapping of Victor Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most powerful businessman, in May 1996. 

 Apparently fearful of more kidnapping attempts, neither father nor son has ever spoken publicly about the kidnapping. Yet Hong Kong media have reported that the Li family paid a ransom of one billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $125 million, without telling the Hong Kong police. 

 Chinese police confirmed Cheung's role in the kidnapping and the $125 million extortion. Police also argued that the crime was planned in Guangzhou, justifying a prosecution here, even though it was carried out in Hong Kong. 

 Cheung, as the kidnapping's mastermind, awarded himself 40 percent of the take, or roughly $50 million, and split the other $75 million among nine associates, a Hong Kong newspaper reported 

 In a second high-profile kidnapping in September 1997, Cheung took half of the $80 million extorted from the family of another property tycoon, Walter Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties. 

 Chinese accounts of Cheung's downfall suggested that it grew out of the cooperation of a gang member. The Hong Kong media have also reported that some Hong Kong property tycoons had quietly expressed their concern about the danger of kidnapping in Hong Kong by cross-border gangs to China's President, Jiang Zemin. 

 Whether Cheung's arrest came about by pressure on the police from Jiang, by a rare case of successful cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong police, or simply by a lucky break, may never become public. But Big Spender's days are over.
