HONG KONG (AP) _ The Chinese death penalty handed down to a reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday he will seek international help to spare his client's life. ``I think they made a mistake,'' attorney Ivan Tang told Radio Hong Kong, a day after a mainland Chinese court delivered verdicts and sentences for Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 35 members of his gang. Tang said he would appeal on grounds that the mainland had no jurisdiction over Cheung's case since many of Cheung's alleged crimes _ including kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons _ were committed in Hong Kong. Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and international rights groups. Some say the case _ the first high-profile cross border trial since the handover last year _ has set a dangerous precedent and befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts and legislators. Crimes committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is imposed, can now be prosecuted in mainland China, where the death penalty is widely used. But many Hong Kong residents believe the end justified the means in the Cheung case, which was tried in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160 kms) north of the border. ``It's better to execute him in China rather than wasting the Hong Kong government's time and money,'' housewife Chan Lee Kit-ho was quoted as telling the South China Morning Post. ``His family should pay the Chinese government for the bullets to execute him,'' an import and export worker, Li Huamin, was quoted as telling the Post. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out there. Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of the defendants were mainland residents. Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can been vastly different under the two legal systems. Legislator James Toh of the major opposition Democratic Party said Friday the court's verdict did not reflect the Basic Law _ Hong Kong's post-handover constititution approved by China and Britain. Toh predicted the verdicts would lower people's confidence in Hong Kong's independent legal system. Tang said that because neither evidence against Cheung nor details of the court proceedings were made known in the territory, Hong Kong residents could face the possibility of arbitrary arrest and trial while in China.
