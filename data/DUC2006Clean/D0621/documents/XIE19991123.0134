NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Procurators, justices and crime prevention officials from 28 Asian countries gathered here on Tuesday to seek improvement of mutual cooperation in their fight against crimes in the region. 

 Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Seventh World Conference of Asia Crime Prevention Foundation (ACPF), Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China Liang Guoqing called for enhancing cooperation among Asian countries to fight crimes and set up a crime prevention regime. 

 The conference, with the theme of Effective Regional Cooperation in Crime Prevention and Crime Justice in the next millennium, is scheduled to discuss and foster strategies and viable approaches on crime prevention. 

 With the world moving toward multi-polarization and integration and exchanges among countries on the increase, Liang said, crime has also become international in nature. 

 Asian countries are faced with the common challenge of combating criminals who flee from one country to another and gang up with local criminals, he said. 

 Therefore, he added, it is imperative to enhance cooperation among countries so as to set up a crime prevention regime. 

 He informed the delegates that China has signed legal assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition treaties with 10 countries. China is ready to exchange experience in preventing and penalizing crimes with all countries, especially those in Asia, he said. 

 Liang also gave a brief account of the procuratorate system in China and the practice and experience of Chinese procurators in the field of crime prevention. 

 Opening the meeting, Indian Law Minister Ram Jethamalani said New Delhi favors creating international pressure against countries which give credence and shelter to criminals and various groups indulging in violence, arson and other unlawful activities. 

 "You can not fight crime at international and global level if a criminal of one society becomes an honorable guest elsewhere and is extended best of hospitality," Jethamalani said. 

 Without naming any country, the minister said perpetrators of crime should not be given "shelter" in any country. 

 ACPF, a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization founded in 1982, strives to promote sustainable development, peace and stability in Asia and the world through mutual cooperation and more effective crime prevention, criminal justice policies and practices.
