FOSHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of a criminal gang in Foshan City of south China's Guangdong Province, which was controlled by a larger and more notorious gang in neighboring Macao, have been apprehended by local police. 

 Police arrested 28 people who have been involved in more than 30 cases of blackmail, gambling, illegal use of guns and other crimes. The gambling cases involved more than 50 million yuan ( about six million U.S. dollars) of illicit money. 

 Police also seized a number of guns and ammunition, including eight military pistols. 

 The gang was established by Zeng Qiqiang in 1996, as a branch of the "Shuifang Bang," a large criminal gang in Macao. The gang in Foshan, with more than 100 members, used to help the "Shuifang Bang" run its gambling operations and collect money from people by force. 

 To date, the provincial public security department of Guangdong and the local police in Foshan have completely uprooted the gang which seriously threatened the security of Foshan and Macao.
