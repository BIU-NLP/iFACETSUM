MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said. The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to punish reporters covering their criminal activities. Witnesses said a police officer's car exploded first. When police and journalists gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb apparently hidden in a motorcycle parked nearby exploded and injured the crowd at around 2 a.m. TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another explosion. Police said the second bomb was believed to have been set off by remote control. The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday. Police said the injured officers were members of the judiciary and security units. Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions. But police said the two incidents were probably not related. The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave. Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the population and the territory's stability.'' Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but the motive was not yet known. They said they were searching for two men, both aged 30. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Macau to take tougher acts against crime lest the violence jeopardize the Portuguese colony's smooth return to Beijing next year. ``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take further, effective measures to recover sound public security,'' Zhu said. Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed shock and anger. The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image. Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking because of Asia's economic slump. Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have been killed since March. Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China. The enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to Chinese rule in December 1999.
