BEIJING (AP) _ Accusing foreign media of plotting to disrupt relations with Macau, a Chinese police chief has denied allegations his officers are linked to a wave of gang-related violence in the Portuguese enclave. Chen Shaoji, chief of police in southern Guangdong province, said the foreign reports about reputed Macau crime boss Wan Kuok-koi sought to give the ``mistaken impression'' that his officers supported criminal gangs in Macau. Chen said the reports ``sought to drench Guangdong police leaders in dirty water,'' the official Yangcheng Evening News reported in its Thursday edition. Guangdong police are not allowed contacts with foreign crime mobs ``except for work requirements,'' the newspaper paraphrased Chen as saying. Wan, also known as ``Broken Tooth'' Koi, was arrested in May after a bomb exploded beneath the car of Dr. Antonio Marques Baptista, director of Macau's Judicial Police. The bombing was part of a wave of violence in Macau, off Guangdong's southeast coast. Three Macau government employees, including the No. 3 official in the gambling inspection agency, have been killed since March. The violence is believed to be part of gang warfare over payoffs from Macau's legal casinos and has strained relations between Chinese and Portuguese officials preparing for China's takeover of the colony on Dec. 20, 1999. Chen, the police chief, said that by blaming the Macau violence on Guangdong police, media reports about Koi were trying to ``create suspicions between Guangdong and Macau police, causing chaos,'' the newspaper said. He did not say which media organizations made the reports. ``These people's plots will absolutely never prevail,'' Chen said.
