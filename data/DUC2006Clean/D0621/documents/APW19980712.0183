BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Portugal Sunday to take tougher measures against gang-related crime in Macau to ensure the Portuguese colony's smooth handover to Chinese rule next year. A committee picked by China to prepare for Macau's Dec. 20, 1999, handover said it ``took note'' of Portuguese authorities' measures ``to benefit the protection of social stability'' in the enclave, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. But the committee also ``hopes Macau's Portuguese government will take even more effective steps and clamp down harder on the criminal activities of evil forces,'' Xinhua said. Portuguese officials are ``entirely responsible'' for social order in Macau until next year's handover, the committee pointed out in a statement at the end of a three-day meeting in Beijing. A spate of shooting deaths, arson attacks and other acts of violence believed by police to be linked to gang wars over Macau's lucrative gambling industry have shaken the tiny enclave as it moves toward Chinese rule. In May, Macau's Portuguese governor chided Beijing for its lax reaction to the troubles and called for a tightening of border controls. Last week, a Chinese police chief denied claims that Chinese officers had given support to Macau's criminal underworld. The Chinese committee preparing for Macau's handover also criticized Portuguese administrators for what it said were sluggish efforts to replace Portuguese civil servants with locally born Macanese. The delay ``is not beneficial for Macau's stable transition and smooth handover of government power,'' the committee said, adding that it was ``deeply concerned.''
