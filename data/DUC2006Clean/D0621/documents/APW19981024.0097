HONG KONG (AP) _ A police chief of a southern Chinese city where a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday. Gang members loyal to ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung have put a 4 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 512,000 million) price tag for the death of Guangzhou police chief Zheng Guoqiang, the Hong Kong Standard said. The assassination threat was said to have been made in a letter sent to Zheng, the Standard said, without identifying its source. Cheung has been charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder. The trial, which also includes 35 other defendants, in Guangzhou 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the border, is closed to journalists. Zheng has been personally leading a fleet of vehicles escorting the defendants from jail to the central Guangzhou city courthouse and back. Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 205 million) in ransom. Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S. dlrs 48,300). Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for security, said on Saturday the government was unable to seek the extradition of Cheung _ a Hong Kong citizen _ for trial in the absence of any hard evidence, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported. Speaking after an anti-crime symposium, she said there had been no hard proof of crimes committed in the territory despite reports that two of Hong Kong's wealthiest businessmen had been kidnapped. Security has been tight since Cheung's trial began Monday. The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to assassinate the defendants to silence them. News broadcasts Saturday showed the defendants being led out from several vehicles _ including armored personnel carriers _ their legs chained, escorted by soldiers in bulletproof vests carrying machine guns and pistols. The news blackout has fueled various reports in Hong Kong's flamboyant media, riveted by one of the most dramatic gang trials in Hong Kong history. On Friday, The South China Morning Post quoted an unidentified prison source as saying that Cheung and other defendants were afraid Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them. They were only eating food brought in for security officials, the newspaper said. Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily reported that two bomb threats have been delivered since the trial began. Cheung reportedly has said that he masterminded the kidnapping of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Ming Pao quoted Cheung as saying. ``There would have been no way that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the gang's kidnapping spree, had he not been arrested.
