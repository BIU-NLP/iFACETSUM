SAINT-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU, Quebec (AP) _ It is a paradox that keeps all of Canada in limbo: Most Quebeckers aren't eager for another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of re-electing a government committed to independence. Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win another term in provincial elections Nov. 30 and begin laying the groundwork for Quebec's third referendum on leaving Canada. If Bouchard is to be stopped, the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party must win in places like Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Montreal. It is a district with a history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly won here in 1994. Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the Quebec paradox. ``The polls show most people don't want any more referendums, and yet Bouchard is still popular,'' Gilles Dolbec said in an interview at his headquarters. ``We can we do?'' In 1994, the Liberals finished just barely behind the Parti Quebecois in the provincewide popular vote yet won only 47 of the 125 legislative seats, compared to 77 for the Parti Quebecois. That gap exists because anti-separatist support is heavily concentrated in Montreal and a few other pockets with large numbers of English-speakers. The Parti Quebecois has strong support in the majority of districts dominated by French-speakers, who make up about 82 percent of Quebec's 7 million population. Saint-Jean is overwhelmingly French-speaking. But, because of its bellwether reputation and the close 1994 result, it is one of 18 districts now held by the separatists that the Liberals are targeting in hopes of eking out a slim legislative majority. Dolbec insists he is optimistic, but interviews with local journalists, politicians, college students and one of their political science teachers gave little indication of any enthusiasm for the Liberals' provincial leader, Jean Charest, who wants to replace Bouchard. ``Charest's not a bad person,'' said Pierre Bergeron, a student at the local junior college. ``He speaks well, but he doesn't develop the issues.'' Bergeron's classmate, Chantal Girard, said Charest _ a native Quebecker who spent more than a decade in federal politics _ is ``too Canadian.'' That can be a damaging image in a province where voters expect their politicians to be Quebeckers first. Both students agreed with political science professor Michel Barrette that many young Quebeckers are apathetic about the campaign. But they predicted Bouchard would win the bulk of the votes cast by young people, even though Charest, at 40, is 19 years younger than the popular premier. Charest has stressed two themes in his campaign _ that the threat of another secession referendum is undermining Quebec's economy and that Bouchard's budget-cutting to erase a deficit has ravaged the public health care system. Yet at the Saint-Jean hospital, the director of medical services said his staff accepted the need for spending cuts and has adjusted to reforms meant to shorten patients' stays. ``Mr. Charest is ringing empty bells,'' said Dr. Stephen Morgan. ``He says what Bouchard has done is awful, but he doesn't say what he'd do instead.'' Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name, said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Mario Dumont. His decision, he said, will be based on prospects for providing effective government, not on the issue of separation. ``I would vote `No' in a referendum'' on secession, he said. ``But I could vote for Bouchard.'' That meshes with the line coming from the local Parti Quebecois candidate, Roger Paquin. ``We're still a separatist party. What we want to do is clear,'' he said. ``But we're also a provincial government, and we have to work for the people now. This election is about a quality government for Quebec.'' Opinion polls indicate two-thirds of Quebeckers don't want a referendum during the next government's term in power. Yet Bouchard appears to be attracting support from some of those voters with his somewhat ambiguous promise to hold a referendum only when ``winning conditions'' exist. Commentators suggest this enables Bouchard to win backing both from hard-line separatists and from francophones who don't want independence but like having a feisty pro-Quebec government that is willing to battle federal officials. ``It's not clear that Quebeckers really want to get rid of ambiguity,'' wrote Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for the Montreal daily La Presse. ``Most francophones have grown used to living with sovereignty's sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. ... It's been talked about for 30 years and it never happens, so what's the problem?''
