OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled here Thursday that Quebec can't separate from the country unilaterally. 

 In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the 9-member court said, the mainly French-speaking province cannot separate from Canada under the Constitution of Canada and the international law. 

 But the top court said, the Canadian government would be obliged to negotiate with Quebec if the mainly French-speaking province won a voter referendum on independence.
