OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ) won enough seats to form a majority government in Monday's general election in the French-speaking province of Canada. 

 The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 75 seats in Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the latest reports from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). 

 PQ's main rival, the Liberal Party led by Jean Charest, got 48 seats, while the Action Democratique party secured one seat from a total of 124 seats up for grabs on Monday, CBC reported. 

 The 125th seat will be decided in a by-election in December because of the recent death of the PQ candidate. 

 The current election mirrored the results from the 1994 election, when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberal 47 and the Action Democratique party one seat. 

 The re-election of the PQ government was widely believed to have much impact on the future of both Quebec and the country of Canada as a whole. 

 In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist. 

 But in his speech to cheering supporters Monday night, Bouchard only briefly mentioned the referendum issue, while dwelling on good government and attacks on Canada's federal government. 

 "We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning referendum on Quebec sovereignty," Bouchard said of the referendum issue. 

 In Ottawa late Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said his government will cooperate with the re-elected Bouchard government if the latter respected the desire of Quebecers to improve economic conditions. 

 "But when he (Bouchard) talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country," Chretien warned. 

 Recent polls also indicated that more than 60 percent of Quebec people did not want to see another referendum in the near future. 

 In the previous two referendums in 1980 and 1995, Quebecers twice voted "No" to the province's secession from the Canadian confederation. 

 While conceding his defeat, Liberal leader Jean Charest said that both Canadians and Quebecers could take heart from the result of the election. 

 "The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success," he noted.
