MONTREAL (AP) _ It was a judgment worthy of Solomon. Canada's Supreme Court managed to rule on the question of Quebec secession without infuriating leaders on either side of a bitter ideological divide. In its unanimous opinion Thursday, the court stated clearly _ as the federal government had hoped _ that Quebec had no right to secede from Canada unilaterally. The ruling was widely considered the most important ever by Canada's high court. But instead of the expected anger from separatists, there was satisfaction over another part of the court's declaration: that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum. ``We've always said that negotiations would follow a vote for secession,'' said Jacques Brassard, a Cabinet minister in Quebec's pro-independence government. ``Now what the court has said is that these negotiations will be obligatory.'' Hard-line anti-separatists also were pleased, because for the first time, the high court said the separatists' longstanding claim that Quebec could decide for itself whether to secede has no legal basis. ``If I were a dancing man, I'd be dancing in the street,'' said William Johnson, president of a Montreal-based group called Alliance Quebec that promotes the rights of the province's English-speaking minority. ``Secessionists have always said that they alone could impose the question (in a referendum), interpret the results as they like and then impose all the conditions of the secession,'' Johnson said. ``It has always been false.'' Secession by Quebec _ where more than 80 percent of the 7 million residents are French-speaking _ would deprive Canada of a quarter of its population and split the four Atlantic provinces from the rest of the country. The ruling is likely to play a pivotal role in Quebec's upcoming provincial election. Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatists' charismatic leader, is expected to hold the vote either late this year or next spring, and he plans to call another referendum on secession if he wins re-election. The latest polls show Bouchard's Parti Quebecois running neck-and-neck with the anti-separatist Liberal Party. The leader of the Quebec Liberals, Jean Charest, said the election would offer a clear choice to voters in the mostly French-speaking province. ``Do we want a government that's going to hold another referendum ... or do we want to get down to the business of building Quebec?'' he asked. Montrealers espoused virtually every possible viewpoint after the ruling. Some were pleased by the balanced nature of the decision; others complained that the court was intruding on a matter that concerned only Quebeckers. ``It isn't up to the courts,'' said Martin Pare, 26. ``When people want to be free, they make that choice themselves.'' Clyde Jennings, a 29-year-old graphic artist, said the ruling sends a message to the Quebec government that secession would involve bargaining and possible compromise. ``It takes the pressure off the separation issue and puts the emphasis on people's rights,'' he said. ``It sends a strong signal that Canada is one country.'' The high court decided to leave some of the thorniest issues to the politicians. It did not specify what victory margin would constitute a ``clear majority'' in a secession referendum, and it did not grapple with the possibility that negotiations over secession might reach an impasse.
