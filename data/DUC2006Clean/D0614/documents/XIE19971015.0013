OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said people in the French-speaking province of Quebec are facing reality about the consequences of separation. 

 Efforts by provincial premiers to solve the unity crisis and his own government's work have opened up communication between Quebec and the rest of Canada, providing a reality check for Quebecers, Chretien said. 

 "This road to heaven just by voting independent has to be put in a realistic context, and it's what we've been able to do for the last two months," he was quoted as saying by reports today. 

 The premiers' unity initiative in Calgary and the "war of words" between the federal and Quebec government have helped clarify the issues, he said. 

 "Before, they (separatists in Quebec) were selling a dream, and now I guess that they have to look at the reality," he noted. 

 The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several decades. People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of separation in the October referendum two years ago. 

 The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial election, which is expected next year. 

 Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because "people in Quebec don't want any referendum," Chretien said. 

 "They're fed up. They don't want us to discuss that any more. He (Bouchard) is dividing the families, creating economic uncertainty," Chretien added.
