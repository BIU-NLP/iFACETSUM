OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian House of Commons Monday began voting on a bill aimed at making separation attempts more difficult. 

 Members of the parliament are expected to spend about 30 straight hours in the process of voting 411 amendments to the draft legislation, which was tabled last December by the ruling Liberal government. 

 The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to the bill, has proposed 403 amendments while the other three opposition parties added eight more to stall the legislation. 

 The roll-call voting will last until Wednesday morning as every MP rises in turn for a total of 411 times to signify their vote. 

 Dubbed Clarity Bill, the Liberal government's Bill C-20 enshrines into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision that found Quebec must win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it can separate from Canada. 

 "We need a clear question and a clear majority," said Prime Minister Jean Chretien last December. 

 The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it sees fit.
