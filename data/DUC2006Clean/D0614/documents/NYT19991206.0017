QUEBEC CITY _ Five years ago, Canada seemed a country about to rip itself apart. 

 In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades. 

 And when Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, vowed that within a few years Quebecers would vote to break away from the nine other provinces, no one could dismiss the vision. The drive to create a French republic north of New England seemed all but irresistible. 

 Today, Quebec's separatist movement lies in tatters. Not dead, certainly, but in disarray. There seems little possibility Bouchard will risk humiliation by calling for another independence vote next year, as he had pledged. 

 But if the separatist cause suddenly bounces back _ and that also remains a possibility in this most unpredictable of provinces where French language, customs, and civil law reign supreme _ federalist folly will be mostly to blame. 

 Recent days have seen officials in Ottawa, Canada's capital, insistent on wagging the red Maple Leaf in the face of the Quebec bull. And that's always risky. 

 Many observers warn that a new ``tough love'' campaign by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a French Quebecer deeply opposed to separatism, represents a monumental political blunder _ one that risks giving Bouchard and his secessionist supporters the lift they need. 

 Even the usual Quebec-baiting voices of English Canada are cautioning Chretien against imposing a law that would spell out, for the first time, the conditions under which Quebec would be allowed to quit Canada's 133-year-old confederation. 

 ``Why get tough with Quebec now?'' asked the Toronto Star in an editorial. ``Bouchard's demoralized troops crave nothing more than a move that could rekindle nationalist passions.'' 

 Chretien's efforts _ which have divided his Cabinet, with some ministers quietly warning that the current course makes no political sense _ have mostly succeeded in appalling Quebecers of all ideological stripes. Only Bouchard's separatists seemed to relish the prospect of renewed confrontation, with the fiery premier railing against ``attacks on Quebec democracy.'' 

 To Americans, Chretien's determination to impose strict ``rules of secession'' might seem sensible enough, a worthy precaution against the day when Quebec might rise again. But French Quebecers, even ardent federalists, have bridled at any suggestion that the rest of Canada deserves a say over their destiny. 

 ``Myself, I don't like separatists; I'm OK in Canada,'' said Denis Cote, a lawyer in the southwestern Quebec city of Hull. ``But I also think Canada has no damn business setting rules for Quebec. Whether to stay or go should be our decision, and ours alone. Every Quebecer feels that.'' 

 Chretien's sudden determination to formalize the rules of divorce seem especially strange given that the Quebec-Canada marriage seems stronger than it has in decades. 

 In Montreal, Quebec's largest city and its economic engine _ and the only center with a large population of English speakers _ businesses and professionals are no longer fleeing in droves to Ontario to escape political uncertainty. The language laws so despised by anglophones are being less rigorously applied, high-tech sectors are booming, and relations between French and English are noticeably friendlier and more relaxed. 

 Into this new bonhomie wades Chretien. 

 ``Canada is my business, sir, and it's the future of Canada we are dealing with,'' the prime minister snapped during a recent news conference, vexed by reporters who questioned Ottawa's timing. ``This has to be done.'' 

 Bouchard characterized Ottawa's hard line as a ``brutal and demented attack,'' and said his province does not need the permission of anyone except its voters to break away. 

 ``After a `Yes' vote, . . . the doors will be wide open to a unilateral declaration of independence,'' he told reporters, barely concealing his glee that journalists were again asking about Quebec's future. 

 For Canada is getting tough on Quebec just as polls show the sovereignty movement going nowhere. A survey released last month found 41 percent of Quebecers would vote ``Yes'' in a vote on separation. That's a long way from the ``winning conditions'' that Bouchard has said must exist before he will call for another referendum. 

 The reason for the decline of support for separatism is difficult to pinpoint. There has been no scandal, Bouchard remains a basically popular figure, and French Quebecers, according to polls, feel as distant from the rest of Canada as ever and still want some sort of new deal. 

 At the same time, familiarity with Bouchard and his governing Parti Quebecois has bred a certain cynicism, if not contempt. Right now, Quebecers are steamed at hospital closures, slashed school spending, public service strikes, and an economy that is lagging behind that of other parts of Canada. Quebec is the country's second most populous province, after Ontario. 

 ``People are unhappy with the basic services that the government is supposed to provide them, whether it's health care, education, job training,'' said political analyst Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Groupe Leger & Leger. ``You can't be trying to talk sovereignty when people aren't happy with the basic services.''

 In 1994, when the separatist Parti Quebecois regained control of Quebec's National Assembly, the provincial Legislature, after more than a decade on the political sidelines, Quebecers were bitter about Canada's refusal to grant the province special political status as a ``distinct society'' under an amended federal constitution. 

 Six years later, no one talks much about ``distinct society'' and the Parti Quebecois seems just another political party _ one that has done an adequate job of running Quebec, but not much more _ while Bouchard, although still respected and personally popular, increasingly seems just another Quebec premier, not the larger-than-life personification of heady nationalist dreams. 

 ``When you govern, you hurt yourself,'' said Alain Gagnon, director of the Quebec studies program at Montreal's McGill University. 

 But some analysts say separatist fortunes could revive if Canada is perceived as trying to bully Quebec. 

 What Chretien is seeking is a federal law that would not forbid Quebec or any other province from seceding, but would lay down formal rules, including that the process take place ``in consultation'' with the rest of Canada and only after a vote in which a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers choose independence. These seem risky demands, but federal hard-liners are adamant. 

 ``We must stop being inhibited by the dual fear of backlash and self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Stephane Dion, a Cabinet minister and point man for the tougher line on Quebec. 

 The federal government has refused to specify what it means by a ``clear majority,'' although the National Post newspaper, quoting unnamed Chretien government sources, reported recently that Ottawa would not accept Quebec's secession unless the separatists win 60 percent of the vote. 

 Bouchard calls this hypocrisy, noting that in 1949 Newfoundland was able to quit the United Kingdom and join Canada with a simple majority vote of 50 percent plus one vote. The big difference was Canada and Britain wanted Newfoundland to switch allegiances. 

 ``The rule has always been 50 percent plus one; that's democracy,'' Bouchard said. ``Making it any different means a federalist vote counts for more than a separatist vote. That's the sort of rule Ottawa wants.''
