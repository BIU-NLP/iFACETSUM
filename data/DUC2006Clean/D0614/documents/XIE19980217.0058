OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada began a landmark hearing Monday on whether the French-speaking province of Quebec has the right to secede unilaterally. 

 The week-long hearing is expected to let the court rule, months from now, on whether unilateral secession is legal under either domestic or international law, and if the two conflicts, which law prevails. 

 Canada's federal government initiated the court case 18 months ago in a bid to lay down legal rules for the political battle over Quebec separation. 

 The move is seen as a key part of Ottawa's strategy of challenging separatists arguments that Quebec has a right to separate regardless of the views of the rest of Canada. 

 The Quebec government is officially boycotting the case, saying that separation is a political issue rather than a legal issue and that the court should not hear the case. 

 Premier Jean Chretien's government is using a biased court to try to rob Quebecers of their democratic right to determine their own future, it argued. 

 "The last word belongs not to one man, not to one government, not to one text imposed from on high.... The last word belongs to Quebec democracy, to the Quebec people," declared Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard.
