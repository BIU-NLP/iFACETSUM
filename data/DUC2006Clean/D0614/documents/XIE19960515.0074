OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum. 

 "We are saying that the laws of Canada must be respected, that there won't be a unilateral declaration of independence and that international law must also be respected," Chretien told the House of Commons Tuesday. 

 The remarks were among the most aggressive and explicit Chretien has made on how the federal government intends to deal with a third independence referendum in Quebec, according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper. They also signal a tougher approach toward Quebec separatists following their near-victory in the most recent referendum on October 30, the paper said. 

 Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence. 

 The federal government is arguing that a referendum is a "consultation", not the first legal step out of the confederation. It also maintains that Canada's constitution would have to be amended to allow Quebec to secede, which would require the consent of all other provinces. 

 Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other provinces. 

 Chretien is creating a climate of "confrontation" similar to that of 1981 and 1982, when the constitution was amended against Quebec's wishes, Gauthier warned.
