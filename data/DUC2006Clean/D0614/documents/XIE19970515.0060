OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians believe that the province of Quebec will face partition if it separates from Canada, according to a poll published today. 

 A Southam News/Compas poll found that up to 78 percent of Canadians outside the French-speaking province anticipate it to lose land as part of the price of independence. 

 In addition, about 50 percent of Quebecers agree that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec, according to the poll, which surveyed 2,450 people across the country from May 1 to 7. 

 The poll found that 92 percent of Canadians living outside Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence. 

 This view is shared by an overwhelming 75 percent of Quebecers. 

 The poll results came as the Quebec issue moves to center stage in the ongoing national election campaign. 

 Further, the results suggest that if Quebecers believe that voting Yes would mean partition, they would be much less likely to vote Yes. 

 "The issue of partition benefits the federalist side," said Compas chairman Conrad Winn. "This may explain the sometimes intense reaction of sovereignists to any discussion of the topic." 

 Before the 1995 referendum, the partition of Quebec was an idea confined to only a few federalist pundits. 

 The narrow win of the No side by 50.6 percent of the vote made many people to consider seriously what they would do if the Yes side ever won a majority. 

 "It's the logical answer: if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien noted shortly after the referendum.
