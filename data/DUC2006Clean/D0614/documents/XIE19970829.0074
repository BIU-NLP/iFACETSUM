OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is set to hear the case of Quebec separation in early December, according to a draft agenda released today. 

 The court has set aside December 8, 9 and 10 to hear arguments on whether the French-speaking province has the right to break away the country. 

 The Quebec government said that it will not participate in the case. 

 Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on three subjects: 

 -- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law? 

 -- Does International law give the province a right to secede? 

 -- If domestic and international law conflict, which take precedence? 

 Quebec cannot unilaterally declare independence though it could leave lawfully through a constitutional amendment after discussing with the federal government and other provinces, Ottawa argues. 

 But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be made only by the people of Quebec. 

 The case is viewed here as part of Ottawa's "Plan B" strategy, which stresses "rules of secession".
