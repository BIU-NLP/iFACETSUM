MONTREAL (AP) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters gave their combative politicians a split decision: the pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon. The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125 seats to earn a new term of up to five years. But the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning only 48 seats, received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43 percent for the Parti Quebecois. As a result, Liberal leader Jean Charest sounded more buoyant in his remarks to supporters than Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatist leader, did in his victory speech. ``The result tonight ... reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition leader in the provincial legislature. The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of political support in Quebec. Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts, mostly around multiethnic Montreal, where the Liberals can rack up huge victory margins. The separatists, whose backing comes almost entirely from Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in a much larger number of districts spread across the province. Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would _ if returned to power _ call for a referendum on seceding from Canada whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory. But with only 43-percent support for his party, Bouchard is likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence. ``There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a government, not a vote to determine the future of Quebec or the future of the country,'' said Brian Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland. ``I wouldn't expect with these results that Mr. Bouchard will be thinking of a referendum any time soon, if ever.'' Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and pledged to work with them on policy matters. But he also promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence possible eventually. ``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ... to push it farther toward its destiny,'' he said. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin reaffirmed U.S. support for an undivided Canada. ``The United States recognizes this is an internal issue for Canadians to resolve within their constitutional, legal and political system,'' he said. ``We have always valued our close and productive relationship with a strong and united Canada.'' Canada's federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day campaign, not wanting to undercut Charest in a province where many francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions. Prime Minister Jean Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in helping strengthen Quebec's economy and social services. ``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country,'' Chretien said. As a personality, the charismatic Bouchard is by far the most popular politician in Quebec. But many Quebeckers who voted for his party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 70 percent didn't want another referendum. One of the most notable results of the election was the strong showing of Democratic Action, the No. 3 party that drew 12 percent of the vote behind its 28-year-old leader, Mario Dumont. The party, which appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession. ``Mr. Bouchard's mandate is clear _ to provide good government and represent Quebec's interests,'' Dumont said. ``He was not elected to do a referendum on sovereignty. Quebeckers want constitutional peace.'' The separatists have lost two previous secession referendums, by a big margin in 1980 and a narrow margin in 1995. Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the separatists would win. About 80 percent of the 5.2 million eligible voters cast ballots in Monday's election, high by North American standards but down from 93 percent for the 1995 referendum. About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers. The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere. The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols.
