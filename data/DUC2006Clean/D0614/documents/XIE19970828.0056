OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unity minister Stephane Dion has fired off another volley of words at Quebec's separatist government in an emotional debate over the province's future. 

 In his latest letter to the Quebec government, Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion warned that Quebec's unilateral secession from Canada would be not only illegal, but impossible. 

 "Without the support of the Canadian government, a declaration of independence would not be recognized by the international community," Dion wrote in the four-page letter, which was published today. 

 "Since 1945, no state created by secession has been admitted to the United Nations without the approval of the government of the predecessor state," the minister noted. 

 In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion "is not allowed to speak for the international community." 

 "He can speak for himself, maybe for the federal government but surely not for the world," Bouchard told reporters. 

 The letter was Dion's second within two weeks in an blistering exchange of words between Ottawa and the French-speaking province, which has been threatening to form a country of its own. 

 The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes. 

 In his first letter to Premier Bouchard, the unity minister warned that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec. 

 "Neither you nor I nor anyone else can predict that the borders of an independent Quebec would be those now guaranteed by the Canadian Constitution," Dion wrote. 

 The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country. 

 Dion also asserted that Quebec cannot simply decide unilaterally to separate from the Canadian federation. 

 He rejected the notion that 50-percent-plus-one majority Yes vote would be suffice for the province to leave Canada. 

 To this, Quebec deputy premier Bernard Landry shot back with a letter, denouncing Dion's letter as anti-democratic and an attempt to "change the rules of the game." 

 Analysts here say the latest letter-writings by Dion suggest that Ottawa is warming up for another showdown with Quebec. 

 Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful. The case is scheduled to begin this fall. 

 It is widely expected that Quebec will hold a provincial election next year. If Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois win, the election would be very likely to be followed by another referendum on Quebec's future. 

 "We are heading towards a new referendum, and there's going to be more heat," predicted Professor Benoit Pelletier of the University of Ottawa. 

 There is already speculation that Ottawa is toughening its stance on Quebec, focusing less on the so-called "Plan A", which involves reconciliation, and more on "Plan B", which stresses "rules of secession."
