OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada. 

 Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts. 

 He will be proclaimed the leader of Party Quebecois at a special party meeting in Montreal on January 27 and will probably be sworn in as premier two days later. He will resign as leader of Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal Parliament. 

 Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated. He took over the leadership from Parizeau in the referendum campaign and he was credited with his role in the final campaign which brought separatists to a near victory from the hopeless mood. 

 Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive. 

 Bouchard has promised to tackle the province's deficit crisis and to create a climate for economic growth. Opinions show that most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its attention to the economy rather than independence after the referendum. 

 Quebec has serious financial problems with one of the biggest debt and tax burdens in Canada. In an editorial, the Montreal daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to governing and tackling the "very serious social, economic and fiscal problems" facing Quebeckers. 

 But Bouchard never hid his goal of Quebec independence. He told quebeckers on the referendum night, last November that next referendum could come sooner than they think. 

 News reports said earlier that Bouchard will consider a fall election in Quebec. The election, assuming that he would win, would position him to hold another referendum on independence next year.
