QUEBEC (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at rowdy young people Wednesday after being pelted with rocks and bottles, the second year in a row force was needed to disperse unruly crowds on Quebec's provincial holiday. Police said 35 people were arrested, many for minor incidents, during a concert and other celebrations to mark Quebec's Fete Nationale, which has been marred over the years by riots and other violent incidents. Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year, when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars of damage. The holiday is celebrated mainly by Quebec's French-speaking nationalists _ those who support either outright independence from Canada or some form of increased autonomy. During Wednesday's holiday parade in Montreal, the hard-line leader of a lobby group for the English-speaking minority was pelted with beer, water and a pie as he marched with colleagues at the tail end of the procession despite objections from parade organizers. The heckling became so bad that police intervened, hustling Alliance Quebec leader William Johnson into a paddy wagon and driving him away. ``We had to stop his walk for his own safety,'' said Jean-Bruno Latour, a Montreal police spokesman.
