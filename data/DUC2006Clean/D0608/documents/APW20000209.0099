WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have. 

 Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them. 

 DaimlerChrysler Corp. began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships in 80 cities for child seat checkups. Under the program, which will grow to 1,000 dealerships by year's end, even adults driving a competitor's vehicle can ask DaimlerChrysler technicians if a child seat is properly installed and children are buckled in properly. 

 Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats. Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed. 

 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday. 

 Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R. Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance. 

 If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance, not just crash-test results, Stephanie M. Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. said. 

 "A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said. Parents need instructions in correct installation, Tombrello said. 

 Kathleen Weber of the University of Michigan Medical School suggested the possibility of a weighted rating system that included explanations of tradeoffs. 

 "Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected. 

 Robert B. Waller, Jr., who represents car seat manufacturers, said a single rating system could be misleading. A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. 

 That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said. He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand. 

 Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government, automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly. 

 NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a permanent feature in every dealership. 

 Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly. 

 Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were. 

 Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly. 

 Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp. financed periodic checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the National Safe Kids Campaign. Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats have been inspected since 1996. 

 And starting this month, GM will have a minivan in each state that will be used to conduct car seat clinics at different sites. 

 But until DaimlerChrysler's announcement, no automaker offered parents the chance to make an appointment at dealerships on such a wide scale. 

 DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
