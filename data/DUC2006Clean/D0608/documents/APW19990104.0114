DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will install a device that warns unbuckled drivers with an intermittent chime until they buckle their seat belts. 

 The Belt-Minder system will be used throughout Ford's U.S. product line starting later this year. President Jac Nasser announced the system Monday at the North American International Auto Show's media preview. 

 A sensor in the belt buckle determines if the driver has buckled up; if not, a red light on the dashboard goes on and an intermittent chime sounds until the belt is latched. On most cars and trucks, a chime and light go on only when the ignition is turned on. 

 ``We think it will improve safety belt usage tremendously,'' Nasser said. 

 Drivers who don't want to wear their belts can disable the intermittent chime by buckling, then unbuckling their belt. 

 Nasser said seat belts are ``the most effective safety device there is,'' but that many who occasionally fail to buckle up say they simply forget or are too hurried. 

 Ford said the system eventually will be expanded to include the front passenger seat. The No. 2 automaker said major insurance companies are considering discounts for those who own or lease vehicles equipped with the Belt-Minder.
