WASHINGTON (AP) -- The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the government's chief transportation safety official says few are. 

 Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, asked states Monday to get moving on setting up ``fitting stations'' where parents go to have child restraints installed and checked. 

 Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio, Hall offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving period of Labor Day holiday week. Several were driven by the knowledge that car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children. 

 ``Safety advocates know that children should be in child restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, and in the back seat,'' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat belt. 

 But ``not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with all of these requirements in it.'' Indeed, no state requires booster seats for children 4 to 8, he said. 

 In January, the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting stations. So far, two are doing so, New York and South Carolina. Three others -- Hawaii, Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites where motorists can get trained in using the seats, according to the board. 

 Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Denver and Sacramento, Calif. 

 Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black youths, who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to use them. If seat belt use were universal among young blacks, that could save 1,300 lives a year, he said. 

 He held out New Mexico's graduated licensing law as a fitting model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an expected 22 percent by 2005. 

 The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate license, both restricting night driving and the number of young passengers allowed. A full license is granted only with a clean record. 

 Hall praised DaimlerChrysler, but said ``states shouldn't wait for automakers to do something.'' 

 ``They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment of permanent fitting stations'' -- perhaps at repair shops, firehouses, health centers or places where cars are annually inspected for safety, he said. 

 So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money to help. About $90,000 is available for fitting station demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal year, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
