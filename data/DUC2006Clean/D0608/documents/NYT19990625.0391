KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You undoubtedly have heard about the ``black box'' federal investigators retrieve from an airplane after an accident to help understand what caused the crash. 

 Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight into drivers' behavior before an accident. 

 Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve automobile safety. Other experts, while supporting the concept, say it needs to be looked at more critically. 

 Since the mid-1970s, General Motors Corp. has installed a sensing module along with its airbags that measured and recorded airbag performance. 

 Beginning with the 1999 model year, GM began installing a more sophisticated device that captures five seconds of data before impact. 

 Now investigators can know when the driver applied the brakes in the seconds leading up to the crash, as well as the vehicle's speed, engine speed and gas-pedal position, and whether seat belts were being used. 

 The use of such devices is favored by doctors, engineers and government officials. They say real-world crashes can provide valuable information on how crashes affect the human body. Ultimately the data could provide insights on how to build safer cars and improve treatment of crash victims. 

 Convinced of the recorders' benefits, James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, last month called for the devices on cars, trains, buses and ships. 

 ``It is time for all modes of transportation to realize the unlimited potential that recorder technology has to offer, both in terms of economics and safety,'' he said at a board conference last month. 

 The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list'' of safety improvements. 

 The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however. The biggest one is whether such information could be used against drivers in litigation. 

 ``It has that potential,'' said Bob Langdon, senior partner of the Lexington, Mo., law firm of Langdon, Emison, Kuhlman & Evans.

 As with any new technology, the courts or Congress will have to decide whether the data collected by the black boxes is admissible as evidence, he said. 

 As a trial lawyer, Langdon said he had concerns about who would be collecting the data, how it would be used, how accurate the devices were and how the information would be interpreted, especially if the data contradicted other physical evidence. 

 ``Those are issues that need to be discussed in the near future,'' he said. ``It really needs to be looked at.'' 

 GM conceded that such information might eventually be used in litigation, but the company said it also could be used against GM to prove some type of defect with a vehicle. 

 Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people and vehicles react in accidents. 

 ``I see this as another tool to be used to save lives,'' he said. 

 The idea of a black box for automobiles is not new. Technology that allows for its implementation is new. 

 An early version of the black box was part of GM's first regular-production driver-passenger airbag systems the company introduced as an option in selected 1974 production vehicles. 

 Since then the modules have become more sophisticated and are capable of gathering more data. 

 GM has installed its latest module in hundreds of thousands of GM cars from the 1999 model year. Those cars include the Buick Century, Park Avenue and Regal; the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and Seville; the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette; and the Pontiac Firebird. 

 GM plans to put the module in almost all of its vehicles in a few years. 

 ``This will help us build an objective driver database,'' said Terry Connolly, director of GM's North American Safety Center. ``Currently we don't know how drivers react seconds and milliseconds before a crash.'' 

 Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how drivers react to crashes. 

 While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted. 

 ``This is a very benign set of data that is being collected,'' Connolly said. ``There is more personal information available on the Internet than what will be collected by these devices.'' 

 Besides, he said, GM has to gain permission from the vehicle's owner before collecting the data after a crash. 

 Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too. Ford Motor Co. has installed data recorders in all of its 1999 models. Ford's recorders collect a limited amount of data, said Jennifer Flake, a Ford safety spokeswoman. 

 She added that the Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory Council was looking into the use of recorders to determine what data would be the most helpful for researchers. 

 ``The use of these modules is important so that we can improve our understanding of crashes and so that we have a better analysis of how injuries are coming about,'' said Jeffrey Augenstein, a professor of surgery and director of the William Lehman Injury Research Center at the University of Miami. 

 ``With better understanding, we can better create countermeasures,'' he said. 

 Augenstein, a trauma surgeon, said the future of the devices was what interested him. He said the next step would be to have the devices automatically notify emergency crews when a vehicle was involved in a crash. 

 ``In many parts of the country, crashes occur in isolated areas, and nobody knows about it for some time,'' he said. ``With information from a (positioning system), emergency crews could know almost immediately where the car is and what occurred in the crash.'' 

 GM offers such a system on some models under the name OnStar. It notifies emergency crews when a car's airbag is deployed. Also, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration is testing a system in Buffalo, N.Y., that automatically notifies authorities of a crash. 

 Eventually emergency crews, Augenstein said, would be able to look at what occurred and know what type of injuries the victims most likely would be suffering. 

 ``It is a very, very exciting time in automobile safety,'' Augenstein said. ``There is a lot of opportunity to improve the crash experience. It would be nice to say we know how to prevent all crashes, but there will always be crashes, that is why they call them accidents.''
