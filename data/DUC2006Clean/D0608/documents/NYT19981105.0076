There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety to customers. How the times have changed. 

 Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the safety world. Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only company making safe vehicles.'' 

 Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not to take a back seat. It is letting people know it has built, and continues to build, safe vehicles. 

 At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR;  &LR; the company builds cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life'' situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests. 

 BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message. Mercedes has developed a number of safety features over the years that the company freely allows others to copy. When it comes to a safe vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank. It's a solid vehicle. 

 Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle. It received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star award in crash test ratings. The only other minivan to receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna. Windstar offers such added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash. 

 The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving: side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the object. The beeping is heard only inside the minivan. 

 Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as standard equipment. More air bags, though, are on the way. Since their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are beginning to show up in more and more vehicles. The bags are mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front seats. 

 With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are equipped with ``second generation'' bags. These units tend not to explode with the force of earlier versions. 

 Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat. Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries. 

 Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all models. When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car. 

 This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to some models. The curtains cover just about the entire door. BMW offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers. 

 As of Sept. 1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding around windows to protect against head injuries. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding ruling. 

 Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced cars such as the Toyota Corolla. Some luxury makers are also adding these for rear seat passengers. For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element. Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick. 

 Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop. 

 Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash injuries. Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end collisions. The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting from rear impact by 50 percent. Saab also offers a similar system. 

 Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to prevent spinouts. BMW is including one in its new 3-Series. 

 Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in preventing accidents than airbags. The brakes are intended to prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden stop and to aid in stopping faster. 

 The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how to use them. Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically. Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective. 

 Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency. When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra pressure to the brakes. Mercedes says stopping distances can be reduced by up to 45 percent. 

 Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively. Having the right tires for your make and model and having them properly inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops. 

 Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of low air pressure. The feature can now be found on other General Motors makes. The system is tied to the antilock brake system. When a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the instrument panel indicating which tire is low. 

 Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle. Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire. 

 Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is about. With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the wheel or wheels needing it most. Even if traction is lost on three wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on ice or snow. 

 AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes. 

 Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers better road sight at night. High-intensity discharge, or HID, headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas. These new lights have been designed to help older drivers see better.
