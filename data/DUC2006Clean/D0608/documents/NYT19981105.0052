OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''? Plenty, would seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models to their lineup. And, there are hints that even more makers are about to enter the competition. 

 Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year with the RX 300. Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley. 

 Quigley? 

 Well, more about that later. 

 Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American market, reportedly has one in its future. 

 Jeep certainly isn't sitting by. It has an all-new Grand Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new all-wheel-drive train. Reportedly the only things being picked up from the '98 version are 127 screws. 

 If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider, too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike. Which means anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead _ not just for price, but for features as well. Do you want full-time four-wheel drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive? Do you want a low range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel drive? Do you want room to spare? Do you want to feel the ruts or ride in carlike comfort? How high off the road do you want to be? How easy is it to shift between drives? What's the noise level inside like? How does it feel going around a corner? (Some SUVs, especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an impending rollover. If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it.) These are questions you should answer before putting your money down. 

 Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility owners never go off-road. They simply use them for shopping, commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer. 

 Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must. That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year history, is putting its name on a truck. Sales of the Lincoln Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent. Enter the Cadillac Escalade. 

 The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali. It's not as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its 255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose Acoustimass sound system. 

 The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to desire. The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle. Some have reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the Mercedes family. Make your own comparisons. 

 There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99. There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new seats, new transmission, well, it's all new. Even the spare tire has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle. Chrysler hasn't missed a trick _ it spend $2.65 billion, including $750 million in plant preparation. 

 The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going even if three wheels lose traction. It has a new suspension designed for better ride and handling. And its new 16-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less emissions. Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about anywhere. The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at $34,415 for the four-wheel drive version. 

 The luxury market for SUVs is growing. General Motors added the Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it apart from the GMC Yukon. Its one-price comes with just about everything. The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line, everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any other GM SUV product. It's nicely styled and equipped. While lots of manufacturers are citing the ``carlike'' ride of their SUVs, GM is stressing the ``trucklike'' strength of their models, which may have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames. 

 Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300 ($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation along with comfort features. The RX300 raises the question of what is a SUV? This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving. But it has all the other SUV attributes _ high seating, all-wheel drive, and roomy interior. It also gets better mileage than most SUVs _ around 19 miles to the gallon. 

 Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time 4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450. The vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser. The new vehicles are aimed at becoming the ``King of 4WD,'' according to Toyota. The vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button, a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior. 

 Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility. The ML320 ($34,950) has been cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy, usability and price _ it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee. Consumer Reports puts it at the top of its SUV list. The only problem with the V-6 powered ML320 is availability _ it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced vehicle. This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with V-8 power. Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet wide). 

 Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer. For '99 the Explorer adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink (a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc), Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays messages. On an environmental note, both the Explorer and Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming emissions than before. 

 The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers. These features can also be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer. 

 In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard for mini-sport-utility vehicles. The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system. It includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and descending steep hills. The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee. 

 The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker. These will be available as two-door convertible or four-door hardtop. The V-6 will only be available at Suzuki dealers. 

 Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the East Coast and arrived in New England this fall. Along with it comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X in style, and more importantly, in price. The Kia Sportage starts at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4. The Kia will be available as a two-door convertible and four-door model. 

 Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV. SUVs sit high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than lower profile automobiles. The new Land Rover Discovery Series II offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling feeling. The Discovery features ACE _ active cornering enhancement _ which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the vehicle's body. This is the only vehicle sold in America that offers such a system. 

 The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation of this model. The new model is slightly lower and six inches longer than last year's. The added space goes for cargo and rear-seat passengers. The new model also comes with another first _ an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed. The Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8 engine that has added power and torque. 

 Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX ($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy ($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800), Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper ($27,800), Jeep Wrangler ($14,200), Land Rover Discovery ($34,500), Land Rover Range Rover ($56,000), Mitsubishi Montero ($33,500), Mitsubishi Montero Sport ($18,100), Nissan Pathfinder ($23,900), Oldsmobile Bravada ($30,700), Subaru Forester ($18,700), Subaru Outback ($24,500), Toyota 4Runner ($20,500), Toyota RAV4 ($15,400) and Toyota Land Cruiser ($45,900) 

 Oh yes, what's a Quigley? Quigley is a company that has been converting vans and trucks to four-wheel-drive. Now it is marketing a four-wheel-drive based on a full-size van through Ford, Chevrolet, and GMC dealers.
