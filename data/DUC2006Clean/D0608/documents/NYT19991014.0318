Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated. 

 Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints significantly enhance safety. 

 Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit. 

 ``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman. 

 About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety. 

 There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags. By contrast, front air bags have been blamed for at least 145 deaths since 1990. In those cases, the impact of the bag inflating caused serious injuries. Most of the victims were children and short people, many of whom were not wearing seat belts. 

 Federal officials said more than 2.4 million vehicles with front-seat side air bags are in use, but fewer than 20,000 have rear-seat air bags. Most manufacturers are installing front-seat side air bags, but only Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Rolls Royce are putting them in the rear seat. 

 In its consumer advisory, the traffic safety administration warned that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children whose head, neck, or chest are in close proximity to the air bag at the time of deployment. 

 Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers. 

 ``Purchasers who want such air bags activated, after being advised of the potential risk to out-of-position children, should be able to have them switched on by their dealers,'' the advisory said. 

 The agency also urged manufacturers to allow owners of vehicles with rear side air bags to bring them back to dealers to have them deactivated if the vehicle is likely to be carrying children. 

 The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints, but manufacturers and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat belts and child seats. 

 Indeed, in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a child safety seat. 

 ``We think what the agency has done today is to needlessly scare people,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 

 She acknowledged a child lying on the rear seat with his head near the door or kneeling with his chest against the door would be in danger if the side air bag deployed. But she said a child in those positions would be at far greater risk if the car were hit by another vehicle. 

 Said Schorr of Mercedes: ``For properly restrained children, side air bags are a great safety device that will save lives.'' He said Mercedes plans to contact owners of its vehicles shortly to review the benefits of side air bags used appropriately. 

 A BMW spokesman said the company decided to deactivate rear-seat air bags to give consumers a chance to review the pros and cons.
