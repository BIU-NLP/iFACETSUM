WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used correctly. 

 DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20 percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car seats to protect children. 

 DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today. 

 More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, according to government statistics. 

 ``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman, said at a news conference. 

 Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety Council. 

 Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said. 

 By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about 30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community events. 

 Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000 certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the current number in the United States. There will be two per participating dealership. 

 The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents. 

 Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall says. 

 This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic crashes. 

 When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses to get involved. 

 Hall said at the press conference that DaimlerChrysler's effort went beyond what he suggested for the fitting stations. ``I am confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will step forward now with their own programs,'' he said. 

 General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 

 Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign, a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's dealerships.
