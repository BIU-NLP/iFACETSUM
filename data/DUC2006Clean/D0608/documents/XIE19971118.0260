BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive industry is working with foreign manufacturers to improve the safety records of Chinese-made vehicles, according to today's China Daily. 

 A seminar on automotive safety technology, jointly organized by Machinery Consultants International of the Ministry of the Machine Building Industry (MMBI) and Volvo Car Corporation, was held yesterday in Beijing. 

 "We need to learn from advanced auto manufacturers how better to protect drivers and passengers," said Dong Yang, MMBI science and technology division chief. 

 Leif Engstorm, chief representative of Volvo's China operations, said: "As the pioneer of auto safety innovation, we feel it is our responsibility to work closely with Chinese partners and safety experts to exchange views and technology." 

 A survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Security indicated that there were 288,000 traffic accidents in 1996, with the death toll hitting 73,700, a rise of 26 percent and 25 percent from the figures in 1992. But the proportion of deaths per 10,000 vehicles declined from 30.2 in 1992 to 25.6 in 1996. 

 As the automotive industry watchdog, MMBI has issued a set of regulations governing automobile safety in the last couple of years. 

 It has decided to build large scale simulation facilities to carry out collision tests and promote the production of automobile safety systems.
