WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top federal safety official is urging automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first. 

 ``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. 

 ``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he said. 

 Hall is sending that message to automakers in a speech he was delivering today at the World Traffic Safety Symposium in New York City, an event being held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show. 

 In his prepared text, Hall warned: ``We need look no further than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not doing so.'' 

 Air bags inflating in low-speed crashes have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children. 

 On Wednesday, Hall sent the speech to top auto executives along with a letter urging them ``to discuss with your peers the need to reverse the trend of motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause of death among young Americans.'' 

 Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children between ages 5 and 15. This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes. 

 When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997. 

 Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries. The back seat is now empty in those crash tests. 

 The Safety Board also has recommended automakers: 

 --Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks, including the rear center seat, where they are often missing. 

 --Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests rather than rise up at their necks. Most autos have adjustable shoulder belts only in the front seats. 

 --Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats. 

 In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes. More than 80 percent of child seats are installed incorrectly, studies show.
