WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at a quarter of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car seats to protect children. 

 DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said Wednesday. 

 More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, according to government statistics. 

 By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said. 

 By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates 30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community events nationwide. 

 DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton was announcing the initiative today at a news conference. Also involved is the child seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety Council. 

 The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents. 

 Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall says. 

 This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic crashes. 

 When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses to get involved. 

 So far, only DaimlerChrysler has come forward but other automakers are considering the proposal. 

 General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 

 Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign, a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or daylong child safety seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's dealerships.
