OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall. 

 The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now. 

 "We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers. 

 "If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned. 

 Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers. They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada. 

 However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper. 

 Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts. 

 In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts. But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly. 

 In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
