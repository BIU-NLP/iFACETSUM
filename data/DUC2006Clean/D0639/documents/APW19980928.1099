UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday on an Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation into U.S. claims that a Sudanese factory it bombed last month was making chemical weapons. Council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said he had received a letter from Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak, the current head of the informal group of Arab states, known as the Arab Group, with a copy of the draft resolution in it. ``But the conclusion of today's discussion was that consultations will continue among members,'' Dahlgren said. The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the plant produced chemical weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX. Washington says the El Shifa plant was also linked to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect in last month's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. Sudan says the plant produced medicines and veterinary drugs. Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims immediately after the Aug. 20 attack, but the council shelved the matter after initial discussions. Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty and territory, and a violation of international law.'' Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to justify the bombing.
