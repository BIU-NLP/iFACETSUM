SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- High-ranking officials were not immediately notified and alarms were ignored during a tiny leak of dangerous nerve gas at the Army's chemical-weapons incinerator in May, according to a report by the plant's operators. 

 The report from Army contractor EG&G Defense Materials Inc. blamed the leak in Tooele, Utah, on a chain of events that began when debris jammed the feed chute of a rocket kiln.

 The report said an inexperienced operator flushed the kiln with too much air, pushing unburned nerve gas out an emissions stack. 

 The report also said a supervisor was preoccupied with administrative work, higher officials were uninformed about the leak and warnings were ignored because of a history of false alarms. 

 The state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said the leak -- the size of a drop -- wasn't dangerous, but the plant remains shut down for investigation. 

 EG&G's general manager, Michael J. Rowe, said much of the plant -- except for the problem furnace -- should be running again by mid-July.

 The Tooele incinerator helps the government comply with a 1985 law that requires the destruction of deadly chemical agents -- including nerve gas, mustard gas and VX gas -- once part of the military arsenal.
