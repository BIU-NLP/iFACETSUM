UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States has no reason to oppose a fact-finding mission to a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant it bombed last month if it is certain that deadly chemical agents were being produced there, Sudan's foreign minister said on Tuesday. Mustafa Osman Ismail also said the United States must compensate Sudan for cost of the plant he said used to produce more than 50 percent of his country's medicines. ``We wonder why the Americans are opposing the sending of a fact-finding mission if they are so sure of their own findings,'' Ismail said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly. The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced chemical weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX. The United States also says the plant had ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa last month. The Security Council held preliminary discussions Monday on an Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding a U.N. investigation into U.S. claims that the El Shifa plant was making chemical weapons. Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to justify the bombing. ``The soil is there. The remnants and rubble of the factory are there. The fact-finding mission can easily collect samples from the soil,'' Ismail said. He said it was the duty of the Security Council to dispatch a team to investigate the truth. ``We want back our factory, which we built with our toil and sweat, and which cost us millions of dollars,'' Ismail said. ``We need the medicines, of which the people were deprived as a result of the American attack.'' Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims immediately after the attack, but the council shelved the matter after initial discussions. Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty and territory, and a violation of international law.''
