BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads. Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, an adviser to President Saddam Hussein, said U.N. inspectors were using the issue to prolong the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990. The statements ``are a part of a dubious fabrication,'' the statement read on state-run television said. A second round of tests on the missile warheads did not provide further conclusive evidence that Iraq loaded VX on the missiles, although there were signs that Iraq had cleaned the pieces between the initial U.S. tests in April and the tests in June and July. Despite the lack of additional proof, U.N. and chemical weapons experts from seven countries said they were still satisfied with the initial tests in April that the Iraqis had used the VX for warheads. Saadi, the mastermind of Iraq's chemical weapons program, reiterated earlier Iraqi claims that Baghdad never succeeded in stabilizing the VX gas and turning it into a weapon. Saadi said the conclusion of U.N. experts contradicts scientific fact and is ``full of disgraceful scientific fallacies.'' Saadi said Iraq never tampered with the warheads. Any attempt would have been observed by U.N. monitors in Baghdad who keep the warhead fragments under camera surveillance, he said. U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction _ and the missiles to deliver them _ before the 15-member Security Council will lift the sanctions. &UR; lb-as
