The New York Times said in an editorial on Fri., Aug. 28: 

 Americans of both parties rallied around President Clinton's decision to launch military strikes against alleged terrorist installations in Afghanistan and Sudan. But the administration's refusal to share more information about its choice of targets and timing is disturbing. By its excessive secrecy, Washington only increases skepticism about its claim that the Shifa chemical factory in Sudan was really producing nerve gas ingredients and thus had to be destroyed to prevent new terrorist attacks. 

 The White House says it has ``compelling'' evidence, in the form of soil samples, for its claims about the Shifa factory. But until it shares some of that evidence, legitimate questions can be asked about the justifications given for the Sudan attack. 

 The administration says the soil samples contain Empta, a chemical not found in nature and with no known uses outside the manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX. But Washington will not produce the samples or detailed results of its tests on the soil. Sudanese authorities insist that the plant was used to produce pharmaceuticals, noting that the U.N.sanctions committee had authorized the Shifa factory to export veterinary medicine to Iraq. The Sudan has invited an international mission to come and collect its own soil samples. 

 Washington has also had trouble sustaining its original claim of a direct financial link between the Shifa factory and Osama bin Laden, the alleged master terrorist Washington accuses of organizing this month's deadly bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The administration has repeatedly contended that it had to strike the bases in Afghanistan quickly to head off new terrorist actions. But it has so far been unable to show any clear connection between the Shifa plant and any specific terrorist plan. 

 If the plant was not an immediate threat, Washington should have explored opportunities to resolve the Shifa question by diplomacy before resorting to cruise-missile attack. Sudan has previously acceded to U.S. requests, for example by expelling bin Laden in 1996. 

 These uncertainties make it imperative that the soil samples, test results and other aspects of the administration's case be more widely shared. If Washington cannot be more forthcoming, it should take up Sudan's offer to let international investigators examine the Shifa site. Nerve gas components like Empta are long-lasting. If they were in the soil two months ago, they are probably still there. 

 The United States has the right to use military force against factories and training camps where terrorist attacks against U.S. targets are being prepared. But the administration owes it to world opinion, and the American people, to demonstrate that it has chosen its targets carefully.  &QL;
