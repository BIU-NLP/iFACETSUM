WASHINGTON _ In the days since the United States bombed what it called a secret chemical weapons plant in Sudan, some of the key statements made by administration officials to justify the attack have proven to be inaccurate, misleading or open to question. 

 U.S. officials continue to say they bombed a facility that produced a key ingredient for a deadly nerve agent. But their descriptions of the plant as a highly secretive, tightly secured military-industrial site, their initial statement that the plant produced no commercial products, and their statements that the exiled Saudi millionaire, Osama bin Laden, directly financed the plant, do not appear to be factual. 

 Administration officials' efforts to strengthen their case have been complicated by the extreme secrecy they imposed in launching the attack, which they now say prevents them from showing their evidence to the world. That secrecy and the inconsistencies in their public statements have given the Sudanese government, which the United States calls a sponsor of international terrorism, a chance to challenge the justification for the attack and call for an international inquiry. The administration's refusal to endorse an inquiry also has become an issue in the international debate over the attack. 

 President Clinton personally chose the bombing site, a pharmaceutical plant in an industrial area of northern Khartoum, as the target for U.S. cruise missiles, declining to strike any other among a larger set of targets presented to him by military planners. 

 But it is unclear whether the CIA ever told Clinton that it was also a medicine factory with a United Nations contract. 

 ``There may have been better places to go,'' a Pentagon official said Friday. ``That doesn't mean it was the wrong place to go.'' 

 Clinton said Monday that he stayed awake ``up till 2:30 in the morning trying to make absolutely sure that at that chemical plant there was no night shift.'' He added: ``I didn't want some person who was a nobody to me, but who may have a family to feed and a life to live, and probably had no earthly idea what else was going on there, to die needlessly.'' 

 The plant made both medicine and veterinary drugs, according to U.S. and European engineers and consultants who helped build, design and supply the plant. The plant they describe was not a tightly guarded chemical-weapons facility patrolled by Sudanese soldiers, as a senior intelligence official described it last week. 

 Briefing reporters hours after the attack on the plant, the senior intelligence official said: ``We have no evidence _ or have seen no products, commercial products that are sold out of this facility.'' That representation was also made by the CIA to the nation's most senior military officers, Pentagon officials said. 

 The point the senior intelligence official was trying to make in his briefing was that ``this was not a normal pharmaceutical facility,'' his spokesman said Friday. His focus was on the presence at the plant of Empta, a precursor chemical used to make VX, a deadly nerve gas, the spokesman said. Senior U.S. officials said that the CIA secretly took a soil sample from a few yards outside the plant that, upon analysis, contained Empta. 

 The plant ``just didn't lend itself to making chemical weapons,'' said Tom Carnaffin, a British mechanical engineer who served as technical manager at the plant during its construction from 1992 to 1996. Workers there mixed pre-formulated chemicals into medicines, he said, and lacked the space to stockpile or manufacture other chemicals. 

 But another government official said ``you could spin several scenarios'' as to why Empta was found at the plant, including suppositions that the chemical was stored or transported there. Other officials now say it is unclear that Empta was actually produced at the plant, but insisted that the soil sample proved the factory's complicity in making VX. 

 Several chemical-weapons experts outside the government say the single soil sample, if it was not carefully preserved and quickly tested, could have misidentified the key ingredient. They said Empta is chemically similar to several commercially available pesticides and herbicides, including the well-known commercially available weedkiller called Round-Up. Senior government officials say they are sure the CIA's chemical analysis was correct, and the most compelling evidence they saw for attacking the plant. 

 The CIA did not make clear to senior military officials that the plant produced a large share of the medicine used in Sudan, a Pentagon official said. 

 The Pentagon official said: ``Some of the intelligence people didn't know they would find any of that there,'' referring to shattered remnants of medical products found in the wreckage of the plant after the attack. 

 A spokesman would not say Friday whether the intelligence agency told Clinton that the plant made medicine, or whether the agency deemed that fact important. Several government officials said any aspect of the plant beyond the presence of Empta in it was irrelevant. 

 Secretary of Defense William Cohen, in briefing reporters shortly after the attack, said that bin Laden, the exiled Saudi multi-millionaire whom the U.S. blames for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, helped finance the plant. 

 ``We do know that he had contributed to this particular facility,'' Cohen said. The U.S. government has presented no evidence to support that, and some U.S. officials now say bin Laden's financial support for Hassan al Turabi, Sudan's leading political figure, as well as for the Sudanese military and intelligence services did not directly flow to the plant itself. 

 Officials at the White House, the Pentagon and the CIA insist that they hit the right target, and cite the soil sample as proof. 

 ``I do not sense here any question about the legitimacy of this target,'' one administration official said. ``We have confidence in the soil sample. It categorically demonstrates the presence of a compound good for just one thing _ making VX by the Iraqi method. The plant was set up with the encouragement of Turabi who urged bin Laden to finance it. End of story.''
