UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 22 Arab states at the United Nations have again asked the Security Council to approve a U.N. investigation of the U.S. attack on a factory in Sudan, according to a document released Wednesday. The United States destroyed the Khartoum factory in August after bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa, saying the plant made chemical arms and had links to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden. Sudan insisted the plant made only pharmaceuticals. The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the president of the Security Council requesting Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatch a mission ``to verify all facts concerning the Al-Shifa factory, including its production and ownership.'' The resolution asks Annan to submit a report on the mission's findings within one month of the resolution's adoption. Sudan requested a U.N. investigation immediately after the attack and demanded compensation from the United States for the cost of the plant, which it said was used to produce more than 50 percent of the country's medicines. The Arab Group also asked for an investigation, but the council shelved both requests. The United States says a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed that the plant produced chemical weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX. The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has imposed trade and other economic sanctions. The United States has accused bin Laden of being the architect of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans. On Aug. 20, the United States bombed the Khartoum factory and a site in Afghanistan that Washington said was a terrorist camp funded by bin Laden.
