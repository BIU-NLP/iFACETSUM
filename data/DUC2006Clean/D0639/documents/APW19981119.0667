THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Human rights investigators Thursday called for an international investigation into claims that Bosnian Serb forces may have fired nerve gas at Muslims fleeing Srebrenica in 1995. After speaking to about 35 survivors of the attack on the Bosnian enclave, Washington-based Human Rights Watch said their accounts suggest Bosnian Serbs fired the BZ nerve agent at the refugees. Officially called 3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, BZ is a nerve agent similar to the drug LSD which produces hallucinations in victims. Witnesses said Serb mortar shells released a low-hanging cloud of colored smoke. Shortly after the shelling, refugees began hallucinating; some killed friends, others committed suicide, Human Rights Watch said in a press release. However, the group conceded that its two-year investigation had failed to turn up any physical evidence of a gas attack such as chemical traces in shells or on the clothes of victims. It handed its findings to the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague which is investigating alleged atrocities in Srebrenica. In a press release, Human Rights Watch said it wanted an international investigation ``to bring justice to the victims, strengthen international controls over the proliferation of chemical weapons and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former Yugoslavia.'' Tribunal spokesman Jim Landale confirmed investigators would check the claims. The U.N. court has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, for genocide for allegedly masterminding the mass murder of Muslims following the July 1995 takeover of Srebrenica, a U.N.-designated ``safe haven'' in eastern Bosnia. The detailed indictment against Karadzic and Mladic makes no mention of the use of nerve gas. Neither man is in custody. Human Rights Watch claimed that the former Yugoslav People's Army, known as the JNA, had BZ gas in its arsenals before the 1991 breakup of Yugoslavia. Although the Serb-dominated JNA officially pulled out of the war in Bosnia in early 1992, it left much of its military hardware in the hands of the Bosnian Serb Army, which was responsible for the takeover of Srebrenica. Human Rights Watch also claimed that U.S. authorities investigated the nerve gas allegations but never published their findings. Thousands of Muslims are believed to have been massacred in the aftermath of the Bosnian Serb takeover of Srebrenica. A tribunal judge who read a summary of evidence of the killings said it contained ``scenes from hell, written on the darkest pages of human history.'' (mc/bk)
