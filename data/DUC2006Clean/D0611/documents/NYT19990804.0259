Bugs. A lot of people see them and respond with the bottom of their shoe. John Howard Garrett, a local gardening expert on all things organic, sees them as a positive byproduct of a chemical-free way of life. 

 In Garrett's eyes, very few bugs are bad, most are beneficial, and several, wasps for example, are downright gorgeous. Garrett, who tends to vault onto his soapbox at every chance, teamed with Malcolm Beck, a like-minded soul, to write the definitive work on regional insects, the ``Texas Bug Book'' (University of Texas Press, $24.95, soft cover). 

 The book is a hit. Bugs, it seems, are much more attractive than ``Plants of the Metroplex,'' another Garrett tome. 

 ``This book is outselling my others,'' he says. ``It appeals to groups I never even considered. Children are fascinated by it.'' 

 While the subject may be off-putting to some, those who open the cover are almost immediately captivated. 

 Most folks haven't spent much time looking at bugs since their roller-skating, scabby-knee days. This book takes readers back to the time when a stick and a bug meant hours of summertime entertainment. 

 The authors beguile their readers with homey stories about their bug observations, satisfy the scholarly with all the scientific names and descriptions, and tempt the bookstore browser with a multitude of photographs. 

 A useful appendix lists beneficial insects, the reason they make the good-guy list and their preferred habitat. Garrett includes his basic organic program and some of his most-requested organic recipes. 

 The road to publication was rough for Beck and Garrett. The way was littered with the objections of several doctorate-wielding entomologists who kept the presses from running for three years. 

 ``The general philosophy of the book is: If you have healthy soil, plants can resist diseases and insects as well. Some entomologists don't believe plants have an immune system. We do,'' Garrett says. 

 Writing the book changed some of Garrett's notions about what were acceptable gardening methods. 

 ``I have completely changed my recommendations on pesticides,'' he says. ``I don't like the organic pesticides any more than the chemical ones. They kill beneficials. So Malcolm and I have switched over to biological things or use repellents. Garlic, for example, is a systemic, it's a cleansing kind of thing, and it works as a repellent, too. 

 ``It becomes more and more apparent, if you understand how it works, that we need all these bugs. Nature is in balance. We are the ones who have created the imbalance.'' 

 He concludes: ``We have to stimulate life, we've got to stop killing and we have to stop trying to dominate the systems. By eliminating the chemical pesticides and fertilizers, we'll see better results and more bugs. But that's a good sign.''
