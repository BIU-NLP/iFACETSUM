One of the best things to happen to salads in decades is that zippy Italian green called arugula. It's literally a weed in Italy, and it would grow just as easily in anybody's garden if not for one tiny problem: the flea beetle. 

 Flea beetles are minuscule black insects that appear early in the spring and spend the rest of the season leaping among the plants, chewing holes in leaves. They hop like fleas, hence the common name. If there are enough of them, they can nibble seedlings to the ground. 

 Actually, there are several species of flea beetles. Some prefer nightshade family plants like eggplant and tomatoes, and some prefer cabbage family plants like broccoli and arugula. In my garden, the cabbage-eaters are more numerous, and they adore arugula. 

 If I sow arugula seeds in early spring, to take advantage of the cool weather they like, I have to swathe the spot in one of those diaphanous row covers immediately, before the seeds germinate. If I don't, the flea beetles will chomp the seedlings into oblivion the moment the first leaves peek above the surface. 

 Even so, the flea beetles know the arugula is there. They alight on the protective cover, patiently waiting for me to lift it to snag a bunch of arugula, so they can sneak in and start munching. I imagine saliva dripping from their little jaws. 

 It is no comfort to know that this pest is an accidental import, like the European corn borer, the Japanese beetle and the gypsy moth. Flea beetles are thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia. 

 They got off the boat in British Columbia and made their way steadily eastward. The North American countryside is rich in cabbage family weeds like yellow rocket and winter cress, and the flea beetles flourished. 

 The tiny terrorists arrived in the Northeast in the 1950s and have spent the last half-century establishing themselves as garden pests, as if anyone needed more of those. Several mild winters in a row have made the problem even worse by allowing more flea beetles to survive. 

 What's a gardener to do? 

 At a conference in New Haven this winter, research scientists and organic farmers pondered the perplexing problem of Phyllotreta cruciferae, the cabbage-crunching flea beetle, as well as its nightshade-noshing cousins. 

 Not much research has been done on the agile insects, because they are not a big problem for conventional vegetable growers. (Pesticides applied to kill other insects tend to keep flea beetles in check.) For organic growers and most backyard gardeners, though, they are tough to control. 

 Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied. They also bound away at the slightest disturbance. Those characteristics put them out of reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly available for home use, because the pesticide has to touch the insects to kill them. 

 Aside from keeping the beetles' favorite foods under cover, farmers reported trying _ with limited success _ to repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays, planting cabbage family crops among aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf blowers adapted to work in reverse. 

 Some tried to snare the flea beetles on sticky traps: pieces of white or yellow poster board taped to bamboo sticks and coated with a gooey product called Tangle-Trap. Flea beetles are attracted to white and yellow, and they paste themselves to the traps in numbers. 

 Kimberly Stoner, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, tried baiting sticky traps with mustard oil, the substance that cabbage-loving flea beetles home in on when they're looking for their favorite snack plants. The baited traps worked, perhaps too well. ``I suspect that they attract many more beetles than they trap,'' she said. 

 Those tempted to try this at home should be warned that concentrated mustard oil can make eyes water and burn skin. 

 Repellent sprays, traps and covers are usually enough to keep flea beetles from doing fatal damage to crops like broccoli, turnips and rutabagas, but nothing can keep them from making unattractive holes in leafy greens like arugula and mizuna, a mild Japanese mustard that's also splendid in salads. 

 For now, there is only one solution to the flea beetle problem: grow the most vulnerable crops in the fall. Flea beetles run roughshod over the garden until autumn, when they stop reproducing and start looking for a cozy place to spend the winter _ in the soil, fallen leaves or a grassy spot. From September until hard freeze, the arugula is pristine. 

 What do Italians do about flea beetles in the arugula? Nothing. The beetles aren't considered a big problem in Europe, suggesting that they made it to North America unaccompanied by the natural predators that keep them in check in their native lands. A European study found that up to 90 percent of wintering flea beetles of the arugula-munching variety had been killed by beneficial nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms.
