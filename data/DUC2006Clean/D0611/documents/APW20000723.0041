BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - For the first 15 years of their farming lives, Gail and Mike Thorpe of East Aurora relied on a conventional arsenal of pesticides and fertilizers to grow their fields of fruits and vegetables. 

 But for the last three years, the couple has scrapped chemicals in favor of things like tricho gamma wasps, green lace wings, bars of soap, live bacteria, and lots of weeding. The Thorpes have gone organic. 

 ''It's been like learning to farm all over again,'' said Gail Thorpe. ''But it has been worth it. We feel really good about what's coming out of our fields.'' 

 This past week that feeling was backed by an official designation of their accomplishments. The Thorpes passed a final inspection by the Northeastern Organic Farming Association/New York Chapter, and have the right to claim 896 acres of their farm as ''certified organic.'' 

 These local farmers are part of a growing national trend of organic farming, joining more than 6,000 other growers of everything from fruits and vegetables to animal feeds and food-grade soy beans. 

 Nationally, the organic head count is up 20 percent in two years. In New York, more than 230 growers have earned official organic status, with another 50 or so expected to pass muster this growing season. 

 Although less than 2 percent of all food produced in the U.S. is certified organic, annual sales now total more than $6 billion said Sarah Johnston, executive director of the New York branch of the organic farming association. 

 ''Our farmers are still the little guys, but we're seeing a steady growth trend as consumer demand grows and producer awareness increases,'' she said. 

 By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances, such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay. 

 While any farmer can opt to use these methods, those who want to label the fruits of their labors as ''certified organic,'' are required to go through a three-year process that includes extensive documentation. 

 While the ranks of organic farmers are steadily increasing, it's still considered an oddity. Steve Porter, in his 11th year of organic growing, is the state's largest organic vegetable producer. He said he continues to be scrutinized by non-organic neighbors. 

 ''We're still considered the weird ones,'' Porter said of the Elba farm he runs with his father, Jack, and brother, Bill. ''A lot of them scratch their heads, but a few are getting interested in how this works.'' 

 While other farmers were writing checks for annual applications of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, the Porters have faced higher upfront costs on soil preparation, including equipment, organic substances and labor. 

 ''The costs probably work out to be comparable, but they're paying and applying chemicals several times a year, every year, while our biggest costs are up front,'' Porter said. 

 Over the past decade, the Porters have seen their organic business bloom from a one-acre vegetable patch to more than 500 acres of produce. 

 The goods find their way to the table via Wegmans and Tops supermarkets, health food stores, food cooperatives, natural foods wholesalers, and the farm's own Community Supported Agriculture program. 

 Through the CSA program, participants pay up front for a season's worth of produce, and receive weekly installments of fruits and vegetables from early summer through early winter. More than 160 families in the Buffalo and Rochester areas are currently paying about $200 each for the steady supply of organically-grown goods. 

 The Porters also produce organic grains sold to organic dairy farmers as feed, and raise food-grade organic soy beans to ship around the world for tofu production. 

 While declining to discuss profits, Porter said he hasn't had to ''run to the bank to borrow money.'' 

 ''You don't go into farming to get rich,'' he said. ''We're holding our own financially, expanding our acreage and finding new markets, so I guess we're a success.''
