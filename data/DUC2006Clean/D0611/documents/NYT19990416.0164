Adjectivally speaking, the most coveted garden flowers tend to be choice, delicate, exquisite or elegant, and preferably also fragrant. Roses, in other words, or lilies or lilacs or masses of sky-blue flax on gracefully nodding stems, but definitely not marigolds. 

 Not many would describe the fat, heavy flower of a marigold, jammed so full of petals that it looks more like a Koosh ball than a blossom, as delicate or elegant. Odoriferous comes to mind, but not fragrant. 

 Still, there are other attributes worth considering in a garden flower. Colorful, easy, reliable and pest-free are not bad adjectives, and if the marigold is more often thought of as common than as choice, those qualities may explain why. 

 There is much good to say about a flower with a sunny disposition and a desire to please. In August, when most perennials are in their summer sulk and the annual flower garden looks a bit ratty, marigolds can be counted on to look presentable. The season is long, and fidelity in a flower is as praiseworthy as flamboyance. 

 They don't look any different than they did in late June _ mounds of roly-poly flowers in shades of orange, yellow and sort-of red _ but marigolds look good when their neighbors are starting to fade. Indeed, it would be nice to be an iris in one's youth and a marigold in middle age. 

 It's true that a large bed of one variety of marigold can be a bit boring. The plants are so uniform that a mass looks stiff and soldierly. They look better planted in clumps among other annuals or in drifts in front of evergreens or shrubs. 

 But there are so many varieties of marigold that it would be fun to plant a marigold library, the way some botanical gardens plant libraries of daffodils and roses. 

 There could be tall African marigolds, rising to three feet or more, and sprightly dwarf French marigolds, some only six inches tall. Giant-flowered hybrid marigolds, with their impossibly huge, puffy flowers, could contrast with signet marigolds and their dime-size blooms. There could be quite an array of flower shapes, too. 

 Not all marigolds have the carnation form, which is the term used to describe those petal-jammed flowers. There are many varieties of single-flowered marigolds, which have a single rim of petals and look like gaily colored daisies. 

 A particularly interesting one is Striped Marvel, which has a single tier of thin petals, red on one half and yellow on the other. It makes a bushy two-foot plant, but most single-flowered marigolds are dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties that grow no more than a foot tall. Disco is one of the best, and it comes in a mixture that includes a delightful array of yellow, orange and bicolored flowers. 

 Marigolds in the Sophia class fall somewhere between the single-flowered and carnation-flowered types _ they have a double rim of petals, russet-red or orange edged with gold. 

 The marigold color range is limited to oranges, yellows, near-reds and combinations of those colors, although breeders have come up with several varieties so pale yellow that they appear ivory or white. White marigolds have less of the characteristic scent, making them nice for gardeners who don't grow marigolds because they object to the smell. 

 To my nose, the scent of marigolds is much nicer than that of some salvias, which smell like a used litter box, but olfactory preferences vary. 

 The scent is probably why marigolds, which make fine cut flowers, do not get used in floral arrangements more often. Most of the smell, however, is concentrated in the foliage. The flowers themselves are almost odorless. If you strip off the foliage, the scent of marigolds won't permeate the house. 

 You can also grow marigolds that don't have the characteristic scent. Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia), also called gem marigolds, have citrus-scented foliage that is lacier than standard marigold foliage and a lighter shade of green. The blossoms are small and dainty, with a single rim of petals. Mexican mint marigold (T. lucida), also called Mexican tarragon marigold, has the scent of anise and can be used in cooking as a substitute for tarragon. 

 Some gardeners plant marigolds as a companion to vegetable crops, assuming the scent is a pest repellent. It's true that some marigolds can help control certain species of destructive nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms, but it's a chemical in the marigold roots, not the odor of the foliage, that does the trick. 

 Only French marigolds (T. patula) are effective in controlling nematodes. African marigolds (T. erecta) and other varieties, including hybrids, won't work. You also won't see any benefits until the year after the marigolds are grown, because the chemical is released from the roots as they break down in the soil. 

 If nematodes are a problem in your garden, rotating the vegetable patch with a bed of French marigolds may help. Simply planting marigolds among the tomatoes and peppers probably won't do much, although it will certainly look nice. 

 Marigolds like full sun and soil that is decent but not too rich. To keep them blooming steadily, snap off the spent flower heads occasionally. There are some sterile varieties, called triploids, that do not set seed and will keep blooming even if the dead flowers are not removed, but even those will look better if they're cleaned up periodically. 

 If marigolds can't be elegant or exquisite, they can at least be immaculate. &QL; &QL;
