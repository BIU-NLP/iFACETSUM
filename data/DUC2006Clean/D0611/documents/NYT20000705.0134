Viburnums Under Attack 

 Q. In my Western New York garden I used native viburnums, partly because they are supposed to be more pest resistant. Now, I find that my arrowwood and cranberry bush viburnums are being attacked by something. The leaves look more like lace tatting, and underneath some of them I am finding small larvae. If native shrubs are supposed to be more pest resistant, why are they being attacked? Is there something I can do about it? 

 A. Native shrubs and trees are normally better adapted to the resident pests as well as to the climate, but the viburnum leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni) is a stranger who has come to dinner. 

 Originally European, the beetle was first discovered in Ontario in 1947, and has now migrated to 27 Western and Central counties of New York, as well as Maine. 

 The larvae skeletonize leaves in May and June, starting from the bottom of the plant and working their way up, and the adults finish up any leftovers from July to October. 

 Eggs are laid in slits on the underside of the tips of young branches in nice, straight lines that appear as dark brown bumps. And that's the key to their control. 

 Prune and remove any branch tips that have eggs laid in them, any time from mid-October, when the adults finish depositing them, to early May, when the larvae hatch. 

 Left untreated, heavy infestations can kill vulnerable viburnums in two or three years through repeated defoliation. Plants too large to prune can be treated chemically. Call your local county cooperative extension for the name of a control product labeled for use against the viburnum leaf beetle. 

 Most vulnerable to the beetle are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), European cranberry bush (V. opulus), American cranberry bush (V. trilobum) and, to a lesser degree, Sargent viburnum (V. sargentii), and their cultivars. 

 Hybrids and cultivars of Viburnum x burkwoodii, V. carlesii, V. x juddii and V. rhytidophyllum resist the beetle. 

 Raking vs. Mulching 

 Q. We've been using a mulching lawn mower regularly for several years now. When leaves start to drop in fall, we mulch and leave them in place as well. We cut once or twice a week. Our lawn is one of the better looking and healthier ones in the neighborhood. 

 However, we can't convince any of our neighbors that they should stop picking up grass clippings and spending hours removing leaves in the fall. Why do the majority of homeowners insist on the removal of grass clippings and leaves from their lawns? That is, are there big risks associated with mulching? 

 A. Don't brag about your lawn; it just sets the neighbors to dumping more fertilizer on theirs. Just mention that according to studies done at Michigan State University, the nutritive value of mulching and leaving grass clippings saves 20 to 25 percent of the fertilizer one would ordinarily use. And then talk about how improved your golf game is since you have been spending more time with a club and less with a rake. 

 And if they start talking about thatch buildup, inform them that a three-year Cornell University experiment found no difference in thatch thickness or quality of turf between areas where 6 inches of fallen leaves, both oak and maple, were shredded by a mulching mower and left on the grass, and areas where the leaves were raked off. Thatch is the dead, dying and decaying organic matter, mostly old turf stems, that accumulates in a layer just above the soil. 

 But weekends can't be all golf. You either have to rake or run the leaves over with a mulching mower. You can't just leave them there because they'll block the light and eventually kill the grass, along with your neighborhood reputation.
