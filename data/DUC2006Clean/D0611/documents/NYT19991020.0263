WASHINGTON _ When a critical farm chemical is banned by the Environmental Protection Agency, vegetable farmers in South Georgia and Florida may have a simple way to rid the soil of plant diseases and weed seeds _ by cooking them. 

 Experiments at the U.S. Agricultural Research Service Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Fla., have demonstrated that sheets of clear plastic laid over the soil trap enough solar heat to kill most of the harmful organisms. 

 For years farmers have used methyl bromide to destroy weed seed, plant diseases and nematodes, the microscopic worms responsible for billions of dollars in crops losses, in the soil. 

 However, the chemical is known to destroy ozone when it evaporates from the soil and floats to the stratosphere. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will ban its use in 2005. 

 Daniel O. Chellemi, an ARS plant pathologist at the Ft. Pierce laboratory, has shown that the plastic traps heat in the soil in a greenhouse effect. Employed for at least six weeks during the summer, the system can kill off weed seeds and diseases that would otherwise wreck a winter crop, Chellemi said. 

 The system has its limitations. For example, it cannot be used for spring crops because the plastic must lie on the soil for at least six weeks prior to planting, and in the winter before spring crops are planted there is insufficient heat for the system to work. 

 In 1998, Chellemi applied the treatment to four commercial farms in Florida. On three of the farms, yields on solarized fields ranged from 96 to 123 percent of those from methyl bromide-treated fields. A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm, operated by Vero Beach organic grower Kevin O'Dare, because O'Dare does not use methyl bromide or any other chemicals. 

 ``I can't say enough for it,'' O'Dare says of the plastic treatment, which Chellemi calls ``solarization.'' The weed purple nutsedge was close to taking over the 10 acres of O'Dare's Osceola Organic Farm when he turned to solarization. 

 After two years, he said, ``our production was up 30 percent, our labor was down 75 percent, and our profits were up 100 percent.'' 

 The solar sheets are not a perfect replacement for methyl bromide, notes University of Florida horticulture professor Steve Olson, who has collaborated with Chellemi. 

 For example, it is not particularly effective against the nematode that causes ``root knot,'' he said. These worms burrow into plant roots, and intercept nutrients moving up to the plants stems and leaves. 

 Olson has worked with tomato growers Dale and Greg Murray of Decatur County, Ga., on a solarization approach that also use small amounts of approved chemical to destroy the nematodes.
