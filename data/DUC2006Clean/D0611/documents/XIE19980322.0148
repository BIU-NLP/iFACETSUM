CHANGSHA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Spiders once were considered disgusting for their dangerous, ugly appearance. However, for local paddy growers in the Dongting Lake area in central China, spiders have become their best friends for killing pests. 

 Some paddy land has been idle to set up safety for spiders. "If the spiders can pass the winter safely, the pests will not be a threat to the crops," says a local farmer. 

 Chinese books written 2,000 years ago read, "All are happy when spiders are flourishing." A spider eats five-to-six insect pests every day, a local expert says. 

 The lake area is the first in China to study pest control with spiders. Many local villages have benefited ecologically. 

 "The area used to be plagued by pests," recalls Liu Hui, a local expert in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, "and chemicals had been used as the only weapon to fight them." 

 The amount of chemicals used was drastically reduced after spiders were introduced, which has resulted in better quality of farm products, according to the expert. 

 According to local officials, the natural technology has become popular in the area and is expected to be adopted by farmers in other parts of the country. 

 Nevertheless, local people want to gain something from their invention. Xiangyin County plans to turn its vast spider-guarded farmlands into a new destination for tourists, and a school for outside farmers who are eager to learn the cost-effective natural technology.
