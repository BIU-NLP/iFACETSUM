BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables produced in suburban Beijing have higher hygienic standards than before, thanks to the use of biological preparation in pest control. 

 A survey by Beijing Municipal Agricultural Bureau on nine varieties of vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers and cabbage, shows that no organic chlorine or phosphorus are found on their leaves, and the residue of mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals all are lower than the state-set standard. 

 To protect the environment, Beijing forbid the use of organic chlorine and other organic chemical elements in pest control in the 1980s. Farmers were encouraged to use biological preparation instead of pesticide to prevent vegetable and plant diseases. 

 Trichogrammas have been widely used to prevent corn borers in suburban Beijing since the early 1970s. The city also set up factories to breed trichogrammas in the counties of Miyun and Shunyi. 

 Trichogrammas have also been used to kill bollworms, defoliators and other plant pests. 

 To protect drinking water quality in this Chinese capital, industrial plants for producing biological preparation have been established in Miyun, Tongxian and Changping counties in suburban Beijing. 

 At present, biological preparation has been used for the prevention and cure of more than 30 kinds of vegetable and plant pests and diseases. 

 The pest control is carried out on an area of over 33,000 hectares annually, and saves 15 tons of chemical pesticide.
