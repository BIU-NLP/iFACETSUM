WASHINGTON, Va. _ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farms is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated. Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best: eating bugs. 

 David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic farmer, uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units, they're called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most. The mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the organic farm he started in 1995 in the middle of Rappahannock County, home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely make a living. Like the cattle, sheep and goats that keep the pasture trimmed, the chickens take care of fertilizing it. 

 Like every aspect of his $11.5 million farm, the mobile units are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of his experimental farm. Money is no object, and money is not the only objective. 

 The farm is not a rich man's hobby. It is a rich man's business, and Cole, who made his name as president of Internet services at America Online (and his money in a variety of other computer technology businesses), predicts confidently that Sunnyside will turn a profit by 2004. 

 In addition to its wagonloads of chickens, the farm has 424 head of Wagyu cattle (close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef); 60 to 70 varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers; and 8 to 10 varieties of berries, as well as pear, apple and cherry trees. It is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables. 

 But even more important to Cole is Sunnyside's role in promoting organic farming as economic savior. By helping local growers profit in an era when independent farms are struggling, he hopes to create a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the country. 

 The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once have sounded outlandish. But the demand for organic food nationwide is greater than the supply, and sales have increased by at least 20 percent annually for several years. Buyers looking for such food _ independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides, genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay a premium for it. 

 Cole, 47, calls his system network farming: a large central farm is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production marketed through the hub. Sunnyside's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment, not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods. Such a system would be particularly useful in helping small organic farmers compete. 

 The concept is not new. Walnut Acres Organic Farms in Pennsylvania, which Cole just bought, operates in the same fashion. But Sunnyside was set up to be an experimental demonstration farm. 

 ``What he is doing is really rare,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association. ``That he has the ability to have this diversity on his farm makes it unique. It totally encompasses the breadth of on-farm innovation and research. He is really taking new and old ideas and combining all that information into a full farm approach.'' 

 So far three small farms have signed on with Sunnyside, and conversations with a dozen more farmers are under way. The farm pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and gaining organic certification and gives them access to the expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm. It also pays them 20 to 30 percent more than they would get if they were selling conventional food and, more important, gets their products to consumers. 

 ``A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing,'' said Brian Cramer, the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside. Selling at farmers' markets or farm stands, with no middlemen, ``is always preferable,'' he said, ``but some farmers don't want to do it.'' 

 ``Some don't have time to do it,'' he said, ``so they leave it to someone else, and they get taken advantage of.''

 In the summer Sunnyside is opening a market in an 1835 building Cole is restoring in the center of the tiny town of Washington, Va., less than a block from his most prestigious customer, the Inn at Little Washington. Its farmers' products will be sold there, at a farmers' market in Washington, D.C., and to restaurants, the Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler who sells up and down the East Coast. There will be more than 30 varieties of tomatoes, 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds of greens. 

 ``Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms, and that could have a tremendous economic impact on the community,'' said Cole, who has restored the 1720 house on the farm, one of several places he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four children. (One son works for Sunnyside full time, another during the summer.) 

 The original 1,000-acre farm had been in the same family for 276 years. When Cole bought half of it, in 1995, the land had been worn out by conventional farming. It took two years of intensive working and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return, and Sunnyside was certified organic in 1999. 

 DiMatteo, of the Organic Trade Association, said she doubts that aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a scale, and while she greatly admires what Cole is trying to do, she is not certain it will succeed. 

 ``People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize in one crop while they figure out crop rotations,'' she said. ``Wealthy people do organic farming, but profitability is not what it's about, and he's setting a goal of a working farm that is economically feasible. 

 ``This is the food industry. It's not like the technology industry. You can't force nature to perform according to some bottom-line expectations.'' 

 John Burns, a consultant who was hired by Cole in 1995 but left after a falling-out two years later, agreed. ``When there is such an excess amount of capital around,'' he said, ``the solution seems to be spend more money, get more people and get more equipment, as opposed to scaling back and concentrating on fewer things. It's the mentality of his other enterprises: you get enough brain power and enough people and you can get it solved, and farming isn't that way. It's the cycle of life and nature; it's not microchip speed.'' 

 Cole, though, maintains that with enough money and his successful business experience he can help nature along. For instance, his recent purchase of Walnut Acres, the oldest organic food mail order company in the country, provides Sunnyside with built-in marketing advantages. 

 He has also scoured the country for the best people in organic production, like Wes Beall, a cow's version of the horse whisperer: cattle trust him. To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers, who are recruited from two villages in Mexico, Cole provides benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and 401(k) plans, matching the workers' contributions. 

 Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to see which grow best. These varieties, Cramer said, bear more fruit more quickly, and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest controls. Many are heirloom varieties like Roxbury Russet and Grimes Golden apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are immune to a serious apple disease called scab. 

 Sunnyside has its own weather station. It alerts the orchardist when to expect an outbreak of pests and prepare for it. For example, it can pinpoint the moment when the Japanese beetle's larvae are about to emerge. While the commercial grower is bringing out the pesticides, Cole is sending out the chickens. 

 The farm uses animals in an intensive grazing rotation, a technique now being reintroduced into organic agriculture. ``In order to save human labor we enlist animal labor,'' Cole said, ``by having them do what they do naturally.'' For a day or two cattle graze on high grasses in a particular field; when they move on, the sheep and goats come in for a day to eat everything else. They are followed by the chickens, which scatter the manure left behind by the other animals as they eat the weed seeds out of it, at the same time depositing their own nitrogen-rich manure. (The chickens also provide eggs for the farm to sell.) Then the rotation begins again. 

 All of these approaches will be shared at the Sunnyside Institute, to be built on the farm. It will provide information not available from federal and state agriculture agencies, which have spent little time or money studying organic farming. 

 ``No one has ever coordinated all this information,'' DiMatteo said. 

 Cole traces his interest in the environment to his childhood in Hawaii. His family has financed global conservation efforts for 15 years, most recently through the Cole Family Foundation. He chose Virginia for his experiment because of its climate and its proximity to one of his homes. He found the farm through his friend and now neighbor, John Sawhill, president and chief executive of the environmental group the Nature Conservancy. 

 In an interview for ``Dream Makers,'' by Michele Hunt (Davies-Black Publishing, 1998), Cole said entrepreneurs need to redefine capital to include not only money but the earth itself and stop treating it like an unlimited resource. ``Instead of saying the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you have to say we can do something about this. We can change our relationship to the earth.'' 

 Like any rich mogul who comes to town and buys up all the available land, Cole has his detractors. But even those who have parted ways over differences of opinion admire what he is trying to do. 

 Burns, who quit as a consultant, said Cole is ``brilliant.'' But he added: ``He makes it hard for some people to deal with him, because you have to do it his way. He wants to do too much too fast. If I'd had my druthers, I would have managed the farm for three years without growing a thing, but he wanted to have crops in 18 months.'' 

 In early April, Cole was invited to lecture at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London on organic food trends in the United States. In his speech he described his attempt to fuse two totally different cultures: the high-powered, fast-paced world of technology and marketing and a slow-paced place from the past where success is based on the production yields of organic farming. 

 Cole leaves no doubt of his certitude that he can apply the principles of the Internet, where rewards can come at warp speed and most problems can be remedied with brain power and capital, to farming, where even the best-laid plans are subject to the vagaries of nature. 

 ``He wants to do good, and he really sees this as an important step,'' Burns said. ``And being a leader in a previous industrial incarnation, he wants to do the same thing in the organic world. But organic mogul may be an oxymoron.''
