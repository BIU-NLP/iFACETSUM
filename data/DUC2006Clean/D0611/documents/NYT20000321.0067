ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ A growing trend among gardeners today is organic gardening. Maybe you've thought about starting an organic garden, but it seemed too overwhelming. It really isn't. 

 If you can grow a conventional garden, you can grow an organic one, said Dr. Mary Peet, a professor in the department of horticultural sciences at N.C. State University. 

 Organic gardeners don't use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides on plants. When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, wildlife and even insects. 

 Just like you would do if you were starting a conventional garden, look around your yard for an area that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Prepare the site by loosening the soil with a shovel. Add several inches of compost to it. Vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers thrive best in raised beds, which are built 4 to 6 inches above the ground, Peet said. Soil in raised beds drains quickly so plants never sit in water. 

 When selecting plants, choose ones that aren't prone to diseases. Ask your neighborhood nursery and garden center for help in selecting plants. 

 ``Most organic gardeners go through a trial-and-error period,'' said Jeffery Hedgepeth, manager at The Green Thumb Nursery in Rocky Mount. ``Gardeners usually have to experiment to find the best crops or plants that work best with their soil conditions. We can only help point you in the right direction.'' 

 Conventional gardeners control weeds with herbicides, but not organic gardeners. They arm themselves with mulch. Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil. 

 ``Reuse and recycle,'' Peet said. ``Don't put waste in the trash when you can put it back in the ground. Live with nature, not against it.'' 

 A layer of mulch blocks light from weeds and stops or slows their growth. If weeds make their way to the surface, Peet says, buy a good hoe and get to work. Conventional gardeners apply pesticides to the garden to ward off threatening insects. Organic gardeners don't use synthetic chemicals, but they can take other steps to protect their garden from pests. 

 Insects usually attack stressed or sick plants. The best defenses against insect attack are preventative measures, Peet said. Grow plants suited to the site and they'll be less stressed. Don't let plants get too wet, too dry or too shaded. 

 Many plant diseases are encouraged by constant moisture and too little air circulating around plants, Peet said. To remedy that, plan your garden with enough room to accommodate full-grown plants, because water evaporates more slowly and air doesn't circulate well among crowded plants. 

 Organic gardeners work constantly to build nutrient-rich soil. Peet describes the ideal soil as dark-colored, sweet smelling and full of earthworms. Gardeners can achieve ideal soil by continually adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to their soil. 

 Interest in organically grown food is evident at grocery stores everywhere. Consumers are reading labels and buying products that were raised without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.
