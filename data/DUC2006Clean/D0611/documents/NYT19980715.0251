LONDON _ Exchanging their confines for a temporary stay in the open country air, seven prisoners from Her Majesty's Prison Leyhill in the Cotswolds won their second gold medal last week at the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, the Royal Horticultural Society's summer extravaganza. Their show garden, ``Take a Walk on the Wild Side,'' included a woodland garden of wildflowers and grasses under linden and beech trees, with a stream flowing under a stone bridge. 

 ``It is one thing to make a garden, and another to mimic nature,'' Adrian Foulkes, a prisoner, said of the difficulty of forcing bluebells and wild garlic into bloom. Foulkes, who is 39 and is nearing parole on a life sentence for murder, heads the prison's garden committee this year. 

 The flower show, which ended last weekend, is an annual event on the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, in the London borough of Richmond-Upon-Thames, on the Thames River. The show, which attracts horticultural groups and garden designers, uses displays that are designed so that visitors can walk through them. The prisoners' exhibit, situated on the banks of a long canal with spouting fountains, seemed like a real woodland in which one could rest on a willow seat under linden trees. 

 The Hampton Court prize also honored the prisoners' vegetable garden display: a kitchen garden (carrots, onions, parsnips and runner beans) enclosed by cordoned apple and pear trees and a rusty fence overgrown with blackberry bushes from the prison's grounds. 

 The kitchen and woodland gardens were designed by Gareth Goundrill _ not a prisoner, but the 18-year-old son of Jeff Goundrill, who oversees business enterprises at Leyhill. The younger Goundrill made the designs as his final exam for a high school technology course, and the prisoners dug the grounds and planted the flowers, vegetables and trees with the help of the prison farm foreman, Martin Brookes. 

 Leyhill, a minimum-security institution, has been participating in Royal Horticultural Society flower shows at Hampton Court Palace and Chelsea since 1991. ``It is a real pleasure to work with the Leyhill team,'' said Stephen Bennett, the director of the shows. ``They have become good friends; they provide much pleasure to the gardening public, and their skillful use of plants _ all grown at the prison _ makes a valuable contribution to horticulture and the community.'' 

 Leyhill is in the town of Wotton-Under-Edge in the Cotswolds, one of England's best-known garden belts, about 100 miles west of London. The institution, on about 250 acres, with three acres under glass, is surrounded by crumbling stone walls. 

 ``In order to work as a gardener,'' said Tom Williams, the prison's warden, ``a prisoner needs no horticultural experience. But he must be quick to learn, work hard and have a sense of humor under pressure.'' 

 Leyhill's grounds include an arboretum with more than 1,000 specimen trees and a stately home, Tortworth Court, a 60-room mansion that was built in 1853 and is the former seat of the Earls of Ducie. Henry John, the third earl, created the arboretum from 1853 to 1921. The arboretum has been managed by Leyhill since the prison acquired it in the 1940s. Leyhill also maintains pasture land for raising rare Gloucester cattle and runs a museum of old farm machinery in the prison's Tortworth Visitors' Center, which also includes a farm stand. 

 The arboretum is open to the public on weekends and bank holidays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The visitors' center is open the same hours daily. Information: 011-44-1454-260-681. 

 The prison's gardens have become a serious moneymaking enterprise over the last five years. This year, Leyhill has supplied a million carpet-bedding plants to nearby towns, and it distributes organically grown vegetables to 27 other prisons. 

 ``If a prison serves a bad meal, it sours the whole atmosphere,'' said Colin Lennox, the farm manager. And the prison takes the word ``organic'' seriously. Pests are controlled by their natural predators instead of by sprays and pesticides. A computer monitors the prison's nine greenhouses along with irrigation and fertilization. 

 There's an additional enterprise for the Leyhill gardens: They provide organic salads and sandwich fillings for British Airways Concorde flights originating at Heathrow Airport. 

 For all the efficiency of the prison's garden operation, there is one drawback: As Jeff Goundrill said, ``The best gardeners are always being released.''
