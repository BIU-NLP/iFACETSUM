BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials identified two more birds infected with the West Nile virus Friday, one day after they announced that the sometimes-lethal virus had not been detected in the state in almost two weeks. 

 One of the dead birds, a robin found in a residential neighborhood in the city's Jamaica Plain section, confirms the virus is being carried and spread by local mosquitoes, state officials said. 

 Meanwhile, in Staten Island, N.Y. Friday, the first human West Nile infection this year surfaced: a 78-year-old man who reported to a New York hospital on July 22 complaining of dizziness and fever. He was hospitalized for a week and is now at home recovering, said New York health officals. 

 Until Friday the virus had only been detected here in crows, which easily could have flown to Boston from New York, where the virus is most heavily concentrated. But robins don't fly long distances. 

 ``Robins are local and the only way one could've gotten the virus is by getting bit by an infected mosquito here,'' said state Department of Public Health spokesperson Roseanne Pawelec. ``That basically indicates the virus is present in mosquitoes in this area.'' 

 In addition to the robin, another West Nile-infected crow found in a residential Brookline neighborhood was identified Friday, bringing the total number of diseased birds found in Massachusetts to four. All but one were found in the area where Jamaica Plain meets Brookline, not surprising, said state officals, given the tree and pond-filled parks there. 

 Thursday state officals told the public that a mass testing of 7,000 mosquitoes and 200 birds turned up no signs of the virus. Although the newly discovered birds seem to contradict this reassurance, state officials said they were consistent with earlier state predictions that sporadic signs of the virus would surface throughout the summer. 

 ``It's here, and from now until the cold begins, we're going to be concerned about people avoiding mosquito exposure,'' said Alfred DeMaria, director of communicable diseases for the state Department of Public Health. ``I'm sure we'll eventually find infected mosquitoes.'' 

 In 1999 the virus killed 7 elderly people in Queens, N.Y., and sickened 60. New York officials responded to the report of the first human case by announcing they would redouble their aggressive mosquito-spraying campaign. 

 Victims of West Nile virus typically experience flu-like symptoms. In a small number of cases, the virus can cause fatal brain swelling. The elderly, infants and those with weakened immune systems are considered particularly vulnerable. 

 Health officals here issued now-familiar suggestions: wear long clothes when outside, consider using mosquito repellent, avoid parks around dusk and dawn, and empty containers with stagnant water in them. 

 The Culex pipiens mosquito, the type that carries the virus, is currently in the midst of its annual population explosion. 

 In Boston, officals said they would spray pesticides in a two-mile radius around where the two new birds were found. Spraying will occur late at night. They will also continue to lay tiny poison tablets in thousands of mosquito breeding grounds around the city. 

 The Boston prevention effort is dwarfed by the goings on in New York. Friday night, entire area codes in the Bronx were sprayed with pesticides, as were massive Central Park and parts of the chic upper East and West Sides in Manhattan.
