HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Citing a congressional report critical of the handling of a mosquito virus, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Monday called for an improved federal response to outbreaks of infectious disease. 

 The report, which concludes an eight-month investigation by the Democratic staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said last summer's outbreak of the West Nile-like strain of encephalitis exposed the nation's vulnerability to emerging infectious disease. The outbreak should serve as a ''wake up call,'' the report said. 

 ''This is serious and we ought to take it seriously,'' said Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the committee. 

 The report proposes a unified federal West Nile Virus response plan, closer cooperation between experts in the fields of human and animal health and an assessment of state's preparedness to deal with the mosquito-borne disease. It also urges accelerated research into a West Nile virus vaccine and a national web site to keep the public and media informed. 

 The report criticizes the way the Centers for Disease Control responded to the outbreak that resulted in the deaths of seven people in the New York area. 

 Specifically, it faults the CDC for having ''tunnel vision'' after an initial diagnosis in humans blamed their illness on the St. Louis version of the encephalitis virus. 

 Indicators, including a massive die-off of birds in the area, should have alerted health officials that something else was going on, the report says. But a diagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis ''colored CDC's thinking for several weeks,'' and delayed a correct diagnosis, according to the report. 

 Because the two diseases require the same prevention and control measures, no harm was done, the report states. 

 ''CDC failed to expect the unexpected,'' the report states. ''West Nile provided the wake up call. The next outbreak of an infectious disease, whether naturally occurring or deliberately inflicted, may not be so forgiving.'' 

 In a prepared statement Monday, the CDC said the report emphasizes the critical challenges the country faces regarding emerging infectious diseases and said the recommendations in the report can help clarify the importance of strong partnerships among local, state and federal health agencies. 

 ''As noted in the report, CDC has made significant progress in addresing many of the recommendations. CDC takes seriously its leadership role in preparing for emerging infectious disease outbreaks and continues to work to keep Americans safe and healthy,'' the statement read. 

 The report notes that while the CDC and others were investigating human illness, animal health experts were doing a separate investigation into the deaths of birds and horses. 

 ''The cultural and communication divides between the worlds of human disease and animal disease exacerbated the situation, a state of affairs that must be righted,'' the report states. 

 But the main emphasis of the report is on the improvement of the public health infrastructure, and the establishment of disease surveillance and reporting networks to better respond to any future infectious disease crisis. 

 That would include any bioterrorist attack, to which the report says the West Nile outbreak shows the U.S. may be vulnerable. 

 ''There is widespread agreement that the next emerging or re-emerging disease that lands on our shores may be even more challenging than West Nile has proved to be, especially if it can readily be spread from person to person, as diseases like flu and small pox are,'' the report concludes. ''When - not if - such an event occurs, there will be little margin for error in identifying and responding to the disease.''
