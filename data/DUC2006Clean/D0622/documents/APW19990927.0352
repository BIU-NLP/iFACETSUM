NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported in the United States is to blame for at least one of three deaths in the city, federal health officials said. 

 Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection identified a ``West Nile-like'' virus in the victim on Friday and were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said. 

 ``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have some more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the strain of West Nile or a new virus,'' she said. 

 Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region. Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and Europe, never before in the United States. 

 Scientists earlier thought St. Louis encephalitis killed three and sickened 15 other people in the city and neighboring Westchester County. 

 It's possible the numbers could go higher. Spinal fluid samples from 77 people who fell ill but tested negative for St. Louis encephalitis would be re-examined for the West Nile or Kunjin virus, city Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen told The New York Times. Seven of those 77 people died. 

 Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. 

 Brain tissue from victims of the encephalitis outbreak has been undergoing analysis at the CDC and at the Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine. 

 W. Ian Lipkin, the director of the Irvine lab, said his colleagues had identified either West Nile virus or a variant found in Australia, Kunjin virus, in the brains of three encephalitis victims from the city's Queens borough. 

 ``The significance of this is that this particular agent has never been reported in North America,'' Lipkin said Sunday.
