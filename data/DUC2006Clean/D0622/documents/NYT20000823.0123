A mother confines her toddler indoors to avoid the West Nile virus, often running with the child up and down the stairs to release energy. If they venture out, they dart from the door to the car. 

 Is this logical? 

 An American is 50 times more likely to die in an accidental fall, such as while on stairs, than to be killed by the West Nile virus. A person is also about 150 times more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident, according to statistics. 

 Based on current information on casualties, the odds of an American dying of this summer's most-dreaded virus are roughly 1 in a million, the statistical cutoff point for saying something has almost no risk at all. 

 Yet, these odds do not prompt a casual attitude from this Brookline, Mass. mother who has extra reason for concern: She found a dead crow on her own driveway near Coolidge Corner, later found to be infected with the West Nile virus, and learned this week that infected mosquitoes are on her street. 

 ``The West Nile virus is so new,'' said Cindy Leung Yue, 34. ``Anything new makes you worried.'' 

 The West Nile virus has triggered a psychological reaction all its own, tapping into some of our most primitive fears. High doses of statistics don't seem to stop the fear epidemic. This virus scares not just because it's exotic and new, but because many feel so helpless to fight it. 

 Psychologists say people often worry less about risks when they undertake them voluntarily, such as smoking, driving, sun-bathing, or bungee-jumping. They hate risk imposed on them, feeling like a helpless walking target for the ubiquitous mosquito, which can now give us a bad infection, not just a bad itch. 

 ``What do people get most scared of? They don't like things outside their individual control,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts University professor of urban and environmental policy. ``That's why people are often more worried about being a passenger in an airplane than driving a car.'' 

 He added that people also have an exaggerated fear reaction to cluster deaths related to some kind of new event. It may be widely known that heart disease is the leading cause of death among Americans, but the here-and-there reports of those deaths don't pack the kind of emotional power that the West Nile virus does. 

 Yet, psychologists and scientists say it's a mistake for the public to focus on one extreme risk while ignoring more serious ones. It's what some psychologists like to call misallocation of a person's ``worry budget,'' like the smoker who is afraid of flying or the sunbather who eats only organic produce. 

 In the list of health precautions, quitting smoking, exercising, eating a low-fat diet, and regularly washing one's hands to avoid transmitting infectious diseases would far more likely lengthen one's life than extra mosquito repellent to avoid the West Nile virus. 

 There's also the ongoing controversy about whether pesticide spraying may do more long-term harm to humans _ as well as create resistant mosquitoes _ than the West Nile virus. The virus produces mild flu symptoms in the overwhelming majority of people and has been fatal in rare cases among the elderly. 

 Public health specialists note that more people appear to worry about the West Nile virus than the winter flu. While the West Nile virus killed seven people last year _ all of them New York City residents over the age of 65 _ the influenza virus killed about 1,700 people nationwide in 1998. The flu also is most fatal to the very old, very young, and those with compromised immune systems. 

 ``Our reaction to the West Nile virus is clearly based more on emotion than fact,'' said David Ropeik, director of risk communication at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. ``It's out of proportion to the actual risk.'' 

 Furthermore, the New York City health department's fact sheets say that, in infected areas, only 1 percent of the mosquitoes actually carried the virus. 

 Ignoring huge odds against acquiring a rare disease is similar to the public's rationale for playing the lottery, which can carry an even greater improbability for winning. Despite the minuscule chances, people simply reason: Someone has to win (get infected) and it could be me. 

 Not everyone is so emotional about the West Nile virus. Many say they can't understand all the media attention, government resources and public hysteria. 

 ``Maybe the race for president is so boring that people are concentrating on the West Nile,'' said Shai Inbar, a retired biomedical researcher who now works in the computer industry. ``It's more interesting than Al Gore and George Bush.'' 

 But, as with the devil, some people say the virus they know is better than the virus they don't know. 

 ``It's the unknown,'' said Louisa Bertman, a mother of a 7-month-old girl, who has stopped taking long outdoor walks. ``And I worry it's only going to get worse and worse.'' 

 Specialists who study risk perceptions say the alien origins of this virus _ it was isolated first in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda _ enhances its scariness. 

 It's a reminder that the boundaries of our country aren't safe from new invading diseases, particularly in this mobile and diverse society, said Donald MacGregor of Decision Research, a nonprofit firm in Eugene, Ore., that studies risk perceptions in health and environmental issues. 

 ``The AIDS virus made us aware of these exotic diseases in other parts of the world,'' MacGregor said. ``The West Nile virus raises yet another signal that there's new hazards coming to us that we don't understand.'' 

 He said our more reasonable approach to the West Nile virus will come only after we have experience surviving it over time. He said that explains why people don't fear the flu too much. 

 ``We've lived through many flu seasons,'' he said. ``We believe we know how to control it and what to do if we get it.'' 

 Steve Pinker, a psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said people find it difficult to ignore the threat of blood-sucking insects that deposit illness beneath our skin, regardless of statistical odds. 

 Through evolution, he said, such trading of vile fluids has ``given us the willies.'' 

 Pinker, author of a best-selling book, ``How the Mind Works,'' said it is understandable that humans will always have an alarmist reaction to any new threat, and raw facts won't temper anxiety until there's more emotional experience with it. Even if you hear that the chance of the West Nile virus killing you is 1 in one million, he said, ``the mind has trouble with risks associated with that many zeros.'' 

 Another reason the West Nile virus is particularly threatening is that its victims are random and get no ``perceived benefit,'' said Scott Geller, a psychology professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute who studies risk perceptions. 

 As Geller explains it, people often have a psychological need to believe that the misfortune afflicting another person is somehow deserved. Uncharitable as this sounds, it's part of a common belief that those who get hurt must have sought too much pleasure, he said. 

 For instance, a motorist died in an accident because he was driving too fast to get to a party, or a boater died because he dared to make the outing in bad weather. Geller calls it the ``Just World'' hyphothesis, in which people believe bad things happen for a reason. 

 Consequently, when a deadly virus strikes randomly, with mosquitoes passing infection to a passive and unknowing recipient, it threatens people's ability to rationalize misfortune. 

 ``When something looks random like that, people worry that even the good guys can get it,'' Geller said. 

 Whatever the reason, some local residents say they can't help but have a heightened reaction to the West Nile virus _ including lost sleep. 

 Architect James Batchelor, who also lives on the Brookline street where infected mosquitoes were found, woke up at 4 a.m. one recent day to the sound of a buzzing mosquito in his ear. While he turned on the light and smacked the bug, he lay awake wondering if he was the conqueror _ or conquered. 

 Said Batchelor: ``I kept thinking, `What if the mosquito already bit me?' ''
