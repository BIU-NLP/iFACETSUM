ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After confirming the West Nile virus in birds from five upstate counties, state health officials said Thursday the virus is likely present statewide. 

 ''Since we are finding West Nile virus in birds in counties well outside of the area originally infected, and many birds are too young to fly far, it is likely that the virus is present throughout New York state,'' Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello said. 

 Crows that tested positive for the virus this week were in the Albany County town of Colonie, Warrensburg in Warren County, and in the Washington County town of Greenwich. In Dutchess County, the virus was confirmed in a blue jay from Wappingers Falls and a sparrow from Putnam County, found in the town of Southeast. 

 Until the birds in Washington and Warren counties tested positive, the farthest north the virus had been found was in Ulster County and in Onondaga County, near Syracuse. 

 Novello said the news shouldn't unnecessarily alarm people. But she said stagnant water where mosquitoes breed should be monitored and eliminated when possible. 

 State Wildlife Pathologist Ward Stone said the latest discoveries show the virus is here and the public should get used to dealing with it. Most people interviewed Thursday agreed, particularly considering the heavy rains that have saturated the state and given mosquitoes ample breeding grounds. 

 ''There's not much we can do,'' said Bob Foggo, manager of the Colonie Town Pool. ''There's been so much water it's hard to keep it under control ... we've been squeegeeing a lot.'' 

 ''I'd be more concerned with Lyme disease and that deer tick,'' said Arnie Whitcom, the maintenance man at the Colonie pool. 

 ''I think Lyme disease is more of a threat,'' agreed Thelma Hansen, 50. ''We know Lyme disease is horrible.'' 

 Some people who are infected with West Nile virus show no symptoms, but others suffer from flu-like symptoms. West Nile can also cause encephalitis, a swelling of the brain. The young and old and those with weakened immune systems are considered most susceptible to it. Less than one percent of those infected will because seriously ill. 

 Last year, the first U.S. case of West Nile virus was reported in late August, and a total of seven people in the New York City area died and 62 were infected. 

 Hansen said that she would keep her two grandsons, ages nine and 15, covered in bug repellant and would try to cut the long grass in the back yard. 

 ''It's been rainy every day, so it's kind of hard to get back and cut it,'' Hansen said. 

 So far this year, there have been no confirmed cases of humans infected with the virus. 

 Officials at Saratoga Race Course that draws thousands of people a day during its 36-day race meet, said they routinely spray for mosquitoes and flies drawn to the track's well-watered grass and manure piles. 

 ''We're always vigilant,'' said Glen Mathes, spokesman for the New York Racing Association. ''If there's a need to do some more, we'll do it.'' 

 The third and last scheduled spraying of the year was Tuesday. In the wake of the state's announcement Thursday, NYRA may spray again. 

 ''Really, all you can do is keep the mosquito population down,'' Mathes said. ''We'll do everything we can.'' 

 Thomas Ciametta, executive director of Boys and Girls Clubs of Schenectady, said they routinely remove stagnant water from their locations by filling in road crevices and drilling holes in tire swings. 

 Mosquitoes can produce 4,000 times more offspring in tires than in other habitats, officials said. 

 In addition to getting rid of standing water, officials recommend wearing bug repellent limiting time spent outside to hours when mosquitoes are inactive. 

 ''If you are working out in the yard early, with all this moisture, the mosquitoes are still out having breakfast on everyone at 9 a.m.,'' said Foggo of the Colonie pool. 

 As if to prove Foggo's point, Cathy Riccio waved at her 16-month-old son Matthew: ''He's full of mosquito bites. He woke up with a bunch of them.'' 

 The virus, commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East, is spread to humans by mosquitoes. Its appearance in the New York area last year prompted a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes. 

 In Warren County, health officials will move immediately to address the problem, said Harold Robillard, commissioner of administrative and fiscal services. He said the county will consider spraying for mosquitoes.
