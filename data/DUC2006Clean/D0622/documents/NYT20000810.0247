HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The best defense against West Nile virus, the Third World pathogen that has unexpectedly invaded the East Coast, sits in a swampy corner of a county park in the heart of North Carolina's apple country. 

 And clucks. 

 Five white chickens brood in an improvised battery cage perched 4 feet off the ground to protect them against predators. Every day, Henderson County engineer Jerry Robinson feeds and waters thems and collects their eggs. Every two weeks, he draws a tablespoon of blood from a vein beneath one wing. Back at the county health department, the blood is centrifuged and refrigerated, then shipped to a lab in Raleigh to check whether the birds are infected. 

 The African virus that in 12 months has killed seven people, sickened 56 and killed thousands of wild birds from Massachusetts to Maryland _ and for which there is no vaccine _ has not yet turned up in Henderson County's chickens, nor in 57 other ``sentinel flocks'' across the state. 

 But health officials in North Carolina _ and in Georgia and other states that are watching North Carolina for the first signs of virus in the South _ don't expect that to last. 

 ``West Nile virus will probably reach North Carolina late this year,'' said Dr. Nolan Newton of North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources. ``If not, we will see it next summer.'' 

 West Nile virus is this summer's scary disease. Like hantavirus in 1993, Ebola in 1995 and the Hong Kong avian influenza in 1997 _ and a new rodent-borne virus, announced Thursday, that appears to have killed three women in California _ it is a reminder of how easily pathogens that infect animals can leap across species and take humans by surprise. 

 Among public health experts, though, it is a reminder of a second phenomenon as well: the frequency with which infectious diseases that once were thought confined to the Third World are menacing developed countries, too. 

 ``West Nile virus shows us that new diseases can emerge at any time, unexpectedly,'' said Dr. Peter Daszak of the University of Georgia, a specialist in diseases of wildlife. ``It is a sign of our globalized planet, with humans, animals and their products being transported internationally at an unprecedented rate.'' 

 The discovery last summer that West Nile had arrived in New York City, coupled with confirmation this month that the virus is circulating locally in at least four states, has triggered an extraordinary national effort to track the microbe. Led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the initiative has enlisted health departments in 17 at-risk states, which are collaborating to detect the disease as it migrates across borders. 

 Humans acquire West Nile from mosquitoes, which transmit it from birds. Some bird species, such as chickens, can be infected without showing signs of illness: North Carolina's chicken flocks are the above-ground equivalent of canaries in a coal mine. 

 Public health experts predict that West Nile will arrive in Georgia in the bloodstream of migrating birds that were bitten somewhere north of here by infected mosquitoes. When the birds land to rest or feed, they could be bitten by local mosquitoes, which would then transmit the virus to other birds and on to humans. So many migrating birds cross the Southeast that a new CDC study suggests southern Georgia could actually become a significant site for the virus: The coastal plains of Georgia, northern Florida and Alabama are winter habitat for some species that move through New Jersey and New York. 

 There have also been two fatal cases of viral encephalitis, transmitted by mosquitoes, in North Carolina this summer. And south Florida, along with southern Texas, is consistently recording cases of dengue, a mosquito-borne tropical disease. 

 Authorities tracking the spread of emerging diseases fear the situation could get worse. Many insect-borne diseases are kept under control by the arrival of cold temperatures, because most mosquitoes don't survive through winter. But the planet is warming: A study done by malaria experts at Maastricht University in the Netherlands suggests that now-temperate parts of the planet, including the eastern U.S., will become friendlier environments for mosquitoes, and more vulnerable to the diseases they carry. Georgia's risk of malaria, they predict, will rise 1.7 times by 2020. Despite alarm over West Nile and other unrecognized diseases, public health experts stress that the potential for infection is largely under individuals' control. Insect-borne diseases cannot imperil humans unless the insects are given the chance to bite. 

 ``We recognize, in public health, that people are often willing to take risks, for instance smoking, that they themselves can control, and unwilling to accept risks where they feel they don't have any control, such as potentially being bitten by a mosquito,'' said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public Health. ``So I try to encourage people to know that the diseases are out there, that their chances of contracting them are small, and that there are things they can do to lower the risk further. 

 ``They should put screens on their windows. They should cover themselves when they go outside if they can, and use repellents if that is not possible. And they should try to avoid being outside for extended periods during the time when the disease-bearing mosquitos are most likely to bite.''
