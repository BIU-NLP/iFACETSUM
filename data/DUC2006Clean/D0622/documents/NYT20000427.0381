WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the season for encephalitis approaches, Florida public health workers are setting up surveillance for the mosquito-borne West Nile encephalitis virus. 

 The Palm Beach County Health Department will begin drawing blood biweekly from ``sentinel'' chickens on May 22 and ship it to a state laboratory for testing, said Jack Petenbrink, who coordinates the county program. Chickens are used to monitor the prevalence of encephalitis viruses because the mosquitoes that spread them feed on birds. 

 Scientists will examine the blood for signs of the viruses that cause St. Louis, Eastern Equine and West Nile encephalitis _ which often cause headache and fatigue, and in rare cases, coma and death. St. Louis encephalitis affects people. The Eastern Equine variety usually sickens horses, but occasionally occurs in other animals, such as emus, and people, Petenbrink said. West Nile virus can affect people, horses and birds. 

 This year will be the first season county health workers routinely test chicken blood for West Nile virus, he said. 

 That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. 

 Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York. In October, an infected bird was found in Maryland. 

 ``We don't have any indication it's reached Florida yet,'' Petenbrink said. 

 The West Nile virus has killed crows, some sparrows and predatory birds such as hawks and eagles. 

 People get infected most commonly through mosquito bites. After a mosquito bites a bird, the virus moves into the bug's salivary glands, where it stays until the mosquito bites again. 

 So far, the West Nile virus has had only one impact on the county: The U.S. Equestrian Team is moving trials to pick the Olympic dressage team from New Jersey to nearby Loxahatchee. Organizers feared a repeat of last year, when the European Union closed its borders to horses from the Northeast, where at least nine infected horses died. 

 Florida typically has very few cases of St. Louis encephalitis. But cases can number in the hundreds during an outbreak. In 1990, 223 cases and 13 deaths were reported. A 1997 outbreak resulted in nine cases with one death.
