BALTIMORE (AP) - A dead crow found in a downtown neighborhood this week has tested positive for the West Nile virus, making it the third bird found in two weeks in Maryland with the mosquito-borne virus. 

 The bird was found Sept. 18 in the Federal Hill section and tested in a state lab, Mike Morrill, a spokesman for Gov. Parris Glendening, said Friday night. 

 The state Department of Agriculture planned to spray the pesticide Permethrin Saturday evening in a 2-mile area around where the bird was found, including in the Inner Harbor tourist area, Morrill said. 

 The department is targeting populations of the Culex mosquito, which has tested positive for the virus in the past. 

 State officials sprayed the same insecticide Friday at dusk in sections of Howard and Baltimore counties, where two birds with West Nile virus were found last week. 

 No one in Maryland has been hospitalized with symptoms of the virus, which can be passed to humans through mosquito bites. West Nile virus can cause fatal encephalitis, usually among children, the elderly or people with weak immune systems. 

 An environmental group expressed concern Friday about the anti-mosquito spraying, saying the risks of the pesticide outweigh the threat of West Nile to humans. 

 ''The chance of humans becoming seriously ill from West Nile virus is very small,'' the Maryland Pesticide Network said. 

 The group said pesticides such as Permethrin have been linked to brain cancer in children. It said several Connecticut communities have opted not to spray for mosquitoes because of such concerns. 

 However, state officials said the pesticide is harmless and residents do not have to stay indoor during the spraying. Those who still have concerns are advised to leave the spray area or remain inside, Morrill said. 

 Sixty-two people have been tested for the West Nile virus this year, health officials said. 

 Of those, one was suffering from encephalitis; 32 had aseptic, or viral, meningitis; and others suffered from a variety of diseases or conditions, said John Sweitzer, an epidemiologist with the state health department. 

 None tested positive for West Nile virus. 

 ''We've been trying to encourage physicians to submit samples for testing,'' Sweitzer said. ''And with this publicity, we think we're going to get a lot more samples rolling in.'' 

 Residents finding dead or dying birds are asked to call the Department of Natural Resources' toll-free hotline at 1-888-584-3110.
