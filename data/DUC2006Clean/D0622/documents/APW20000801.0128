NEW YORK (AP) - The West Nile virus is here to stay and is likely to keep spreading into other areas of the country, experts said Tuesday. 

 Although there have been no reports of human infections so far this year, ''we have to redouble our efforts, because now is the time when you would see any human cases,'' said Dr. Steven Ostroff, a West Nile authority at the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 

 With the mosquito-borne virus appearing this year in Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland, ''the range is wider than last year,'' he said. 

 Ostroff spoke on a panel at New York University Medical Center convened by three members of Congress ''because New Yorkers have as many questions as answers'' on how to protect themselves, said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY. 

 Last year, with Queens as the epicenter, the first U.S. case of West Nile was reported in late August; a total of seven people in the New York area died and 62 were infected. 

 So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to humans. The latest infestation seems to be centered around Staten Island. 

 Rep. Nita Lowey, D-NY, said New Yorkers are confused about how to act on a day-to-day basis, asking questions like, ''Do I go to Central Park, do I not go to Central Park?'' 

 And especially when it comes to their children, they wonder: ''Are they better off wearing long sleeves and gloves, or just staying in the house all summer?'' 

 Over the winter, health authorities set up a monitoring system to locate and destroy insects infected with the virus while they were hibernating. And several weeks ago, trucks started spraying neighborhoods where West Nile-bearing mosquitoes or birds were found, including Central Park and parts of Long Island and Westchester County. 

 The system ''is working,'' said Ostroff, judging by the lack of human infection. 

 Despite some public concern, the spraying compounds being used are among the safest available, he said. 

 Ostroff was introduced by Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-NY, as the nation's West Nile ''czar,'' backed by $20 million in federal funding for research and prevention of the virus over a two-year period. 

 ''The data are telling us that the virus is here to stay, and is likely to keep moving to other areas,'' Ostroff concluded. Agreed Dr. Marty Blazer, an NYU specialist in infectious diseases: ''It will not go away, it will remain in our ecosystem.'' 

 The West Nile virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East. Its appearance in the New York area last year was the first in the Western Hemisphere, prompting a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes. 

 The first case was detected by Dr. Deborah Asnis, director of infectious diseases at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens. In August of last year, she contacted the city's Department of Health to report two patients with encephalitis, a swelling of the brain which can be caused by West Nile. 

 From now on, ''we believe knowledge and understanding are the most effective antidote,'' Asnis said Tuesday. 

 While some people infected with West Nile show no symptoms, others suffer from a flu-like condition that can include high fever, gastrointenstinal problems, muscle ache, a headache, or mental confusion. 

 The only sure way to diagnose an infection is through a test that detects antibodies to the virus, said Dr. Marcy Layton, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for communicable diseases. 

 Warned Schumer: ''There should be no fear, no panic - but you can't be too careful.''
