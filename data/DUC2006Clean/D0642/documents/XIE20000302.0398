CARACAS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez rejected Thursday a United States' request to permit its planes to over-fly Venezuelan airspace in the war against drug trafficking. 

 Chavez said that his government cooperates with the U.S. authorities in their war against drug traffic. 

 Chavez said in Uruguay, when he attended the new president of that country, Jorge Batlle swearing in, that he understands it as a limiting decision of an operation fundamentally directed against Colombia. 

 According to the analysts, Venezuela does not want to complicate more the relations between those two countries, because it wants to be a factor of harmony instead of aggressions, direct or indirect. 

 The United States approved Wednesday the Venezuelan war against drugs, and also that of other Latin American countries, like Colombia and Mexico.
