CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he was ``completely sure'' Washington would reverse its policy of banning him from the United States. Local stocks soared after his election, he said, because ``we have demonstrated to the world that we are not savages.'' The Caracas stock exchange opened sharply higher for the second straight day Wednesday, continuing a rally caused by Chavez's conciliatory statements after his landslide victory Sunday. The market was up 11.4 percent Wednesday morning, following a record 22 percent hike the previous day. Investors had long feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992 staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, would roll back free market economic reforms and civil liberties. But his statements in the last two days promising fiscal discipline and calling for national reconciliation seem to have calmed investor fears. On Wednesday, the president-elect appointed a 79-year-old leftist politician named Luis Miquilena to oversee the national police force as Interior Minister. It wasn't immediately clear if that decision would affect the markets. Chavez said he met earlier Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador John Maisto, who he said delivered a letter of congratulations from U.S. President Bill Clinton. Because of his earlier attempt to overthrow the government, Chavez was placed on a U.S. list of alien undesirables barred from entering the United States. In recent days, U.S. officials have to moved to improve relations with Chavez, whose country is the number one exporter of oil to the United States. ``I am completely sure that within a few weeks I will be in the United States,'' Chavez said. On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said that heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the United States, adding, ``The U.S. government is prepared to take the necessary steps to address any request for a visa that President-elect Chavez may make.'' Chavez also met Wednesday morning with President Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores presidential palace, the first time the former lieutenant colonel had visited the site since storming it on Feb. 4, 1992 during the failed coup. Palace workers applauded and cheered him. Caldera, 82, was catapulted to the presidency partly because of a speech he gave immediately after Chavez's coup, asking why people would fight for democracy when it ``can't even give them enough to eat.'' ``On the fourth of February two presidents were born,'' said Chavez, who at 44 will be Venezuela's youngest president. Speaking to reporters Wednesday after his meeting with Caldera, Chavez said the stock market rally reflected Venezuelans' peaceful vote for change. ``There is a fresh breeze,'' he said. ``We have broken our chains.'' During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution. Economists say Chavez may have difficulty achieving his economic goals because of a severe recession caused by slumping oil prices. ``The country voted for transformation and now there is no turning back,'' he said.
