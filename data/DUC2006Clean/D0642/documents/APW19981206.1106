CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who staged a bloody coup attempt six years ago, was elected president of Venezuela _ a stunning blow to the political and economic establishment that has ruled for 40 years. People poured into the streets late Sunday, dancing, setting off fireworks and honking horns in celebration of what many viewed a victory of the poor over a political elite that has failed to ease poverty and control rampant corruption. ``Venezuela is being born again,'' Chavez declared as results were revealed. ``Once again, the people of Simon Bolivar have shown themselves to be a grand people,'' he told the Venevision television network. Chavez often invokes South American liberation hero Bolivar in his speeches. With 78 percent of the vote counted, Chavez had 56 percent compared to 40 percent for Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer, according to official results from the National Electoral Council. ``I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is Venezuela's luck,'' Salas said at his campaign headquarters in Caracas. Chavez, who will be sworn in on Feb 2, appealed for national ``reconciliation'' and sought to assure investors that he would pursue prudent economic policies. He said he would not impose exchange controls or other radical economic measures as his opponents have claimed. ``We are going to instill confidence, and that's my first message to investors,'' Chavez said. ``You the investor, if you have capital abroad, bring it here.'' For the first time, neither of Venezuela's two traditional parties fielded candidates. In an effort to head off a Chavez victory, the center-left Democratic Action Party and the center-right COPEI Party dumped their respective candidates during the past week and threw their support to Salas, who had been running second to Chavez in the polls. Until this week, Salas, a former state governor, had taken great pains to distance himself from Democratic Action and COPEI _ aware that most Venezuelans blame them for squandering the world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East. ``Nothing like these elections has happened in Venezuela's political history,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said. In 1992, Chavez led 15,000 rebel soldiers who tried and failed to overthrow Venezuela's democratically elected government. Dozens of people were believed to have died in the attempt, though the actual number was never clear. His critics asserted he would impose a leftist dictatorship and roll back free-market economic reforms. Because of this, his candidacy was seen as a warning by much of Latin America. Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition, which calls for fewer privatizations and a slowing of free-market economic reforms, already won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, breaking the two traditional parties' 40-year political stranglehold. Chavez's call for a new constitution and the dissolving of Congress has scared investors and exacerbated an economic crisis. Foreign oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil, Shell and British Petroleum, have put some of their investment plans on hold. Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United States. An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans, whose standard of living has been steadily declining for more than 15 years. The campaign took on overtones of class warfare. Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrified middle and upper class Venezuelans, many of whom have already fled to Miami. ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper class Altamira district. Chavez voted Sunday amid some 1,000 supporters roaring, ``Chavez! Chavez!'' and ``Viva Venezuela!'' As he drove away, throngs of teenagers chased after his white van. Street celebrations broke out throughout the country Sunday evening; people donned Chavez's trademark red parachutist's beret and hung Venezuelan flags from balconies. ``Down with the oligarchy!'' shouted one woman standing outside Chavez's Caracas headquarters. The voting Sunday was orderly, and turnout was high for Venezuela at 65 percent. Among the trailing candidates was former Miss Universe Irene Saez, who had led the polls until earlier this year. On Sunday, she won 3 percent of the vote, according to the partial results.
