CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A left-wing coalition led by a former coup leader has become the top force in Venezuela's new Congress, initial results showed Monday, in a major setback for the two political parties that have governed for 40 years since the restoration of democracy. With 67 percent of Sunday's vote counted, Hugo Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats. The center-left Democratic Action Party won about 22 percent, and the conservative Copei Party won 11 percent. The pro-business Project Venezuela emerged with about 12 percent of the vote. The 44-year-old Chavez, an independent supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, is the favorite to win the Dec. 6 presidential election. In 1992, he staged an unsuccessful military revolt against the government and became a hero to many for denouncing corruption and speaking out on behalf of the poor. He spent two years in prison and was released in 1994 by President Rafael Caldera. Investors reacted negatively to the strong electoral showing by his coalition, with the Caracas stock exchange dropping 3.2 percent Monday morning. Many investors and businessmen fear Chavez will reverse free-market policies implemented during the last two years by President Rafael Caldera. &UR; Initial results, 7th graf pvs
