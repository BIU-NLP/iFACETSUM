CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A center-left party on Friday endorsed a former coup leader's bid to become Venezuela's next president, a move that could soften the candidate's image and attract young voters. Members of the Movement to Socialism, known by its Spanish initials MAS, voted overwhelmingly during their national convention to support former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who leads presidential polls six years after trying unsuccessfully to overthrow Venezuela's popularly elected leader. The debate over whether to endorse Chavez has uncovered rifts between the party's young leaders and the older generation that founded it. On Thursday, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff, a MAS founder, criticized Chavez and said his populist policies would push Venezuela ``back into the past.'' So far, the December presidential race is dominated by Chavez and former Miss Universe Irene Saez, the popular mayor of a Caracas municipality. ___ GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan court sentenced one man to 25 years in prison and another to five years for leading a village mob that lynched a woman suspected of stealing a child. The crowd killed Maria del Carmen Azucena Gonzalez in March 1997 in the village San Raymundo, 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of the capital. The mob believed Azucena and another woman had stolen a child, a charge Azucena repeatedly denied. Villagers in rural Guatemala have become increasingly violent in dealing with child-stealing rumors and crime in general. This year, 14 Guatemalans have been lynched, according to the private Mutual Support Group. ___ FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Angry growers dumped tons of green bananas at the entrances to government buildings Friday to protest a port workers strike. Berard Capgras told the Caraibes International radio station that the fruit was part of the tons of bananas that producers have lost since some employees went on strike recently at the Fort-de-France harbor. Capgras said the banana producers are desperate. Dock workers went on strike in support of workers at a banana farm in the southern town of Francois on this Caribbean island, which is part of France. More than 4,000 tons of bananas destined for France and other parts of Europe were left on the docks. Some residents took advantage of the protest by hauling away as many bananas as they could carry before cleaning companies moved in to remove the fruit.
