CARACAS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government is conducting a public auction to sell 23 government planes in order to finance the country's social programs. 

 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez attended the opening ceremony on Tuesday and said the government could receive 24 million U.S. dollars from the sale, which is being held at the "Francisco de Miranda" Air Base. 

 "We could spend money to build 3,000 houses and 170 kindergartens," said Chavez. 

 The U.S. company "Phoenix Air" bought 8 planes of "Petrels de Venezuela" (PDVSA), for 4.1 million dollars to Chavez during the ceremony. 

 Millions of Venezuelans are living at a subsistence level in society, far below a humane threshold. They need help and money, Chavez said.
