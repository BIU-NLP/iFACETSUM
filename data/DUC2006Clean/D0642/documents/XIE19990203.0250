CARACAS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's new foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, on Tuesday said his country will seek closer links with the Caribbean countries while boosting ties with the Andean Community of which it is a member. 

 The foreign policy of Venezuela's new president Hugo Chavez, who was sworn in Tuesday, would be based on peace, integration and the defense of human rights, Rangel said. 

 He said the new administration was aiming to trim a bloated bureaucracy in the foreign ministry, and to revamp and modernize it. 

 Rangel said that Chavez had a friendly relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton, with whom he already met as president- elect and will again meet at the end of this month during a trip to the United States. 

 Referring to Cuba, Rangel said that Venezuela wants closer ties with the island disregarding ideological differences. 

 "We call for respect for the Cuban people. We ask for an end to the embargo," he said. 

 Rangel said many Venezuelan businessmen were planning to invest in Cuba.
