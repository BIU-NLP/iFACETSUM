CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _Venezuelan, Mexican and Saudi oil ministerial delegations will meet in Madrid sometime next week to discuss the effectiveness of the three countries' oil policy, Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez said late Saturday. Chavez made the announcement after a two-hour meeting with Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez and state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or PEMEX, head Adrian Lajous. ``The objective is to examine oil policy, to examine the existing oil reduction accords ... and to evaluate what will be the evolution (next year) of the current alliance of the oil community,'' Chavez told reporters. The Madrid meeting, which doesn't yet have a fixed date, will be the fourth formal meeting of the ``tripartite'' oil group composed of Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. The last meeting, held on Oct. 2 in Cancun, Mexico, yielded only a commitment by Mexico to extend its promised oil reductions until June 30, 1999. In its two previous meetings, however, the group initiated and then expanded the current accords among major oil exporters to reduce production. The Venezuelan president-elect also reiterated that his administration will enforce existing oil production reduction agreements made earlier this year. Venezuela promised to slash oil production by 525,000 barrels a day, but Energy Minister Erwin Arrieta recently said that country won't cut more than 440,000 barrels per day during the life of the cutback accords. These accords last until June 30, 1999.
