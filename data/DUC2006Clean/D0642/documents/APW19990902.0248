CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Two more high-level executives resigned from Venezuela's powerful state oil monopoly on Thursday, following the company head's resignation in a dispute over production and management policies. 

 Roberto Mandini resigned Monday as president of Petroleos de Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company and one of the top two suppliers to the United States. He was replaced by company Vice President Hector Ciavaldini, a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 

 Chavez has said he wants to shake up Petroleos de Venezuela, which he has called a ``state within a state'' that enjoys an extravagant ``gold-card culture.'' 

 Since then, a total of five executives have quit. including three vice-presidents. 

 Antonio Marquez, communications director at Petroleos de Venezuela, and Antonieta Mendoza de Lopez, corporate affairs coordinator, are the latest to retire, a company official told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 Chavez has moved to reverse a company policy aimed at expanding production, opting instead to reduce output in order to raise prices. Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year but have more than doubled since February. 

 Some industry analysts said Chavez might endanger the company's reputation by filling key posts with people known more for their political loyalty than energy expertise. They said Ciavaldini had been promoted because of his political connections with Chavez. 

 Ciavaldini, a trained chemical engineer with a doctorate from the University of London, was appointed vice president of the company by Chavez in February.
