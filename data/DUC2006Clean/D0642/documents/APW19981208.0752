CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Caracas stock market skyrocketed Tuesday morning, indicating that president-elect Hugo Chavez's conciliatory comments had eased investor fears that he would roll back free market economic policies. The market leaped by 11.7 percent on the first day it was open since the former coup leader won a landslide election victory Sunday. The market was closed Monday for a holiday. ``Investors have recovered some of their confidence in the country,'' said Leonardo Quintero, a broker at Caracas-based BanFederal. Since his election, Chavez has said he would cut Venezuela's bloated government payroll, reduce the fiscal deficit and honor the country's dlrs 21 billion foreign debt. The 44-year-old former paratrooper is a messiah to millions of poor people who believe he will punish the corrupt, wipe out misery and return their oil-rich country to the days when it was dubbed ``Saudi Venezuela.'' But those expectations may be too high for Chavez's own good. ``People think they are going to start eating better and living better on Feb. 3,'' the day after Chavez is sworn in, said historian Guillermo Moron. ``But that's not true.'' Hours after his victory, Chavez stood on a terrace overlooking thousands of roaring supporters as floodlights lit the midnight air. ``The resurrection of Venezuela has begun, and nothing and no one can stop it,'' he bellowed over loudspeakers. Chavez, who has never held public office, is inheriting a country with an economy in shambles and a political establishment that views him as a villain because of his 1992 attempt to overthrow the government. ``Depressed oil prices and high un- and under-employment mean that the next government will face some very difficult problems, and it will take political skill, courage and resolution to deal with them successfully,'' U.S. Ambassador John Maisto said. The economy went into a tailspin earlier this year when oil prices hit a 12-year low. Venezuela relies on oil for 75 percent of its export revenue and over half the government budget, which has been slashed by dlrs 2 billion this year. Next year isn't expected to be much better. Oil prices are likely to remain low. Yet Chavez has already announced that he wants to boost the current minimum monthly wage of dlrs 175, which is barely half of what workers need to care for a family of five. The question is: Where will the money come from? Many workers are employed by the government. Its 1.3 million-person payroll is one of the most bloated in Latin America. Chavez says he wants to streamline the bureaucracy, but laid-off workers won't find new jobs if the economy doesn't turn around. More than half of Venezuela's population of 23 million already is mired in poverty. Venezuela has Latin America's highest annual inflation rate at 30 percent. Looming in the immediate future is intense pressure to devalue of the currency, the bolivar, and the possibility of a new banking crisis. The financial system nearly collapsed in 1994-95 and required a dlrs 7 billion bailout. Venezuela's new head of state could also encounter political troubles. His leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality in Nov. 8 congressional elections, but opposing parties still control a majority of seats. Chavez also wants to convene a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution and possibly dissolve Congress. That will revive many of the hostilities that erupted during the campaign, which polarized the country between rich and poor and between the Patriotic Pole and Venezuela's two traditional parties. Chavez will have to use his famed charisma to persuade Venezuelans to show patience. ``The rear-guard stabs at reform haven't gotten anywhere because nobody has been able to capture the trust of the Venezuelan people,'' said political consultant Eric Ekvall. ``If anyone has this quality, it's Hugo Chavez.''
