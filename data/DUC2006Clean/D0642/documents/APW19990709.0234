CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Colombia's trade minister should have minded her own business when she criticized Venezuelan trade policy, her Venezuelan counterpart said Friday. 

 The Colombian minister, Martha Lucia Ramirez, this week criticized a Venezuelan law requiring Colombian truck drivers to hand their cargo over Venezuelan drivers at the border. 

 In an interview with the Caracas daily El Nacional, she said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ``talks about integration, but the measures applied by some of his officials are just the opposite.'' 

 Ramirez's comments were an ``undue interference in the internal affairs of the country,'' Venezuelan Trade Minister Gustavo Marquez said in a radio interview Friday. 

 Venezuela said the law was necessary because its drivers were at a disadvantage. Few Venezuelan drivers venture into Colombia because of the presence of leftist rebels and paramilitary squads.

 SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A group representing 29,000 public school teachers announced a series of strikes Friday to demand the government grant them a 30 percent salary increase. 

 Felipe Rivera, secretary-general of the Association of Salvadoran Educators, said the strikes would take place Tuesday in all 14 of the country's provinces as well as on July 20 and 21. 

 Salaries now range between $345 and $505 per month, according to the Salvadoran education ministry. 

 Education minister Evelyn Jacir de Lovo has dismissed the idea of salary increases, instead saying she would institute incentives to reward the best teachers starting next year.
