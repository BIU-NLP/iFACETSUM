DETROIT (AP) -- Despite months of labor peace since last summer's devastating strikes, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich said Sunday that ``we still have our problems'' with General Motors Corp. and hinted at another showdown when national contract talks begin later this year. 

 In a speech kicking off the union's triennial bargaining convention, Yokich said job security would again be the UAW's priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG. The national contracts cover about 396,000 U.S. workers. 

 Yokich reserved his toughest criticism for GM, suggesting to about 2,000 union delegates that little if anything had improved in UAW-GM relations since last year's costly battle. 

 The strikes at two parts plants in Flint brought the world's largest automaker to a virtual halt in North America. They lasted several weeks and cost the company about $2 billion while they idled nearly 200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at independent suppliers. 

 The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,'' the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who generally pay less and typically are nonunion. GM, which once made most of its parts, is moving toward becoming largely a designer and assembler of vehicles. 

 Since the strikes, GM has announced plans to convert its aging U.S. small-car plants to so-called ``modular'' assembly to make them more efficient. The UAW describes it as a threat to union jobs. 

 Under modular assembly, outside suppliers preassemble parts such as an entire dashboard and deliver them to a plant, where they are installed on the chassis. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to assemble each car, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. 

 ``There's nothing new about modular assembly,'' Yokich said. ``It's just another word for ... outsourcing. It's just another way to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits, that we intend to deal with in this round of negotiations.'' 

 The UAW argues that modular assembly will give the automaker less control over design and quality, increase logistical complexity and potentially add to warranty costs. 

 Yokich also bristled at suggestions that GM loses money on its small cars because of its labor costs. 

 ``They claim they lose $1,000 on every small car they build themselves. It's funny, their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- never lose anything on their small cars. So is it our fault or their fault in how they run their plants? It certainly isn't our fault.'' 

 Yokich chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW before it decided to spin off its big parts unit. GM had an initial public offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems stock earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the company to GM shareholders by year's end. 

 The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees, said Yokich, who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little, if any, consultation with UAW leaders. 

 GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company would have no comment on Yokich's remarks. 

 Yokich also said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, should be under the UAW contract. 

 The veteran union leader had no criticism of Ford, which has the best relationship with the UAW among the three automakers. 

 Yokich said the union will begin bargaining with the company that presents the best initial proposal. In 1996, the UAW negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for pacts with Chrysler and GM. The current three-year contracts expire in September. 

 The UAW gained more workers than it lost in 1998, the first time that has happened since 1989, Yokich said. Much of the gain, however, has come in businesses outside the auto industry, such as health care and government.
