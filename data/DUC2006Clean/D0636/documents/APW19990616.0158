AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- When leaders of General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers met Wednesday to start the long process of negotiating a new national contract, there was no sign of the acrimony that has long marked their relations. 

 Just the opposite: It was all smiles and comments chosen to offend nobody. Quite remarkable, too, since just last summer the world's largest automaker and its biggest union were embroiled in a pair of costly strikes that only made their bad relationship worse. 

 ``I guess the days of everybody beatin' the drum and rattling the swords are gone,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told reporters. 

 Gary L. Cowger, the executive GM brought in to repair its union relations, repeated the policy that GM adopted shortly after the strikes, which cost it about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market share it has yet to recover. 

 ``We've said since last summer that it is of utmost importance to the top leadership of this company to improve our communications with the UAW,'' Cowger said. ``We continue to work on that and continue to make that a focus and a priority.'' 

 Even cynical UAW leaders said they were now convinced GM was serious. Richard Shoemaker, the union's chief GM negotiator, said the relationship has changed considerably since the strikes, but that the change has yet to filter down to the plants. 

 ``Obviously, that's where it ultimately has to get to for it to be successful, and I think it would be premature to say it's reached that point yet,'' he said. ``I also think it would be unfair not to say that I believe there's a sincere interest in doing just that.'' 

 GM had good reason to dump its get-tough stance. It need only look to rival Ford Motor Co., which has not had a national contract strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good union relations. Ford today is the most profitable of Detroit's automakers. 

 Last year's strikes were largely over plant work rules and the loss of work to outside suppliers, issues that will be back on the table in these national negotiations. The focus of the work-rule debate is expected to be GM's plans to adopt ``modular assembly'' techniques at its small-car plants. 

 Modular assembly uses outside, lower-cost suppliers to do more subassembly work. The suppliers deliver to the plant large parts ``modules,'' such as an entire preassembled door or dashboard. As a result, fewer high-wage UAW workers are needed for final assembly of the car. 

 The future of workers at GM's former parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., also is a key issue in these negotiations. GM divested Delphi in an initial public offering and stock transfer earlier this year, over the union's objections. 

 As a concession to the union, GM and Delphi have agreed to keep Delphi workers under terms of the new GM contract for at least the next three years, according to sources on both sides who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

 The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began Monday at Ford Motor Co. and were followed Tuesday by an initial meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG. The talks will continue through the summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a lead company to negotiate economic issues. The current three-year pacts expire Sept. 14.
