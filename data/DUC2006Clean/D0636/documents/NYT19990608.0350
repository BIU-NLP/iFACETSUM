DETROIT _ With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950s, auto executives and union officials said. 

 Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against GM in Flint, Mich., and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another showdown this year. Serious differences could still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are now using the tamest rhetoric in many years. 

 Nearly two decades of declining inflation rates have tempered union fears that workers' pay would be ravaged by rising prices during a long contract. For their part, the automakers would welcome the ability to predict long-term costs. The current contract expires Sept. 14. 

 By departing from the traditional three-year contract, the UAW would also be able to avoid having the next round of auto labor talks in the summer of 2002, when the union could be locked in a power struggle. Longtime UAW president Stephen Yokich must retire when his current four-year term ends in June 2002 because he will become 65 next year. The union's rules require that candidates for the presidency, an elected position, be younger than 65, and Yokich has no heir apparent. 

 A longer contract would not assure labor peace in the auto industry, however. Unlike most unions, the UAW won from the automakers long ago the right to hold factory-level strikes for health and safety reasons at any time, even while a contract is in force. Last year's strike in Flint involved such a walkout. 

 Key issues in talks to replace the current contract are certain to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts subsidiaries that are being spun off, as well as modest changes to the automakers' health care plans and other employee benefits, executives and union officials said in interviews and public appearances in recent weeks. 

 The UAW has traditionally negotiated a contract with one auto company first, and then demanded that the other two sign virtually identical pacts. The company that negotiates the first pact has an advantage, in that it can tailor an agreement to its own needs while driving up its rivals' costs. Ford and GM seem to have a better chance of being chosen by the union to negotiate the first agreement than does DaimlerChrysler, but no decision has been made yet, a person close to the union said. 

 GM executives in particular have softened their criticisms of the union and called for reconciliation, in the hope of avoiding another strike. 

 ``We are working hard with all our unions to nurture a more open relationship,'' said GM chairman and chief executive John Smith at the company's annual meeting Monday in Wilmington, Del. ``We want to build on common strengths, improve our cost competitiveness and work through our differences without costly work stoppages.'' 

 But GM has in the past shown a peculiar knack for offending the UAW, sometimes unintentionally. The automaker announced Tuesday, six days before the contract negotiations formally open next Monday, that it would spend $1.8 billion to buy a commercial lending business from the Bank of New York. 

 Although union leaders had no immediate reaction today, they have criticized diversification moves by the automaker, calling on the companies to invest more money in new equipment and factories instead. 

 All three automakers' current, three-year national contracts with the UAW expire at midnight on Sept. 14. Since the Eisenhower administration, national auto labor contracts have lasted for three years, and the triennial negotiations have been closely followed as a barometer of wage pressures in the U.S. economy. While the automakers are no longer the nation's largest private employers _ Wal-Mart overtook GM two years ago _ the wages and benefits set in their contracts still strongly influence the rest of the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the nation's economic output. 

 Inflation and obscure accounting rules discouraged the union and the companies alike from pursuing longer agreements. Inflation caused by the Korean War ravaged the earnings power of auto workers during a five-year pact in the 1950s and prompted union leaders then to vow that future deals would not exceed three years, a decision followed until now. 

 Recent contracts have only partly protected workers against inflation, guaranteeing that, in addition to wage increases, workers will receive an extra 1 percent raise for every 2.6 percentage points of inflation. But the decline in the inflation rate has reduced union worries on this score. 

 Accounting rules also require the companies to charge certain pension concessions against their profits in the first year of an agreement, and the cost of these concessions rises with longer agreements. But with all three automakers posting record or near-record profits, they are in unusually strong financial condition to take such a charge. 

 Yokich mentioned the possibility of a longer contract at a news conference in May. ``With all the money they've got, they might be able to put enough money on that table that we have to take a 4-year or 5-year or 6-year or 10-year'' contract, he said, speaking of the automakers. 

 While auto executives dismiss the idea of a 10-year contract, which would limit their options through at least two generations of new cars, they have been receptive to the possibility of a four- to six-year contract. 

 The UAW has been quarreling with DaimlerChrysler over how much help the automaker should give the union in organizing a Mercedes factory in Alabama and a DaimlerChrysler heavy truck factory in North Carolina. With union leaders also nervous about a showdown with German executives they barely know, the union is expected to negotiate the first contract with GM or, perhaps more likely, Ford. 

 If Ford goes first, it would probably try to work out the terms of an eventual spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems, its auto parts unit. Such a settlement could have major implications for GM In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker, not the subsidiary. 

 In May, GM spun off its 200,000-employee auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems. A big question now is whether Ford will agree to accept huge numbers of workers back from Visteon if it is ever spun off. While Ford could use those workers in its expanding sport utility vehicle factories, GM has too many workers already and does not need more from Delphi. But if Ford signs a pattern-setting contract first, the UAW may force GM to accept the same terms or face another costly strike. &QL;
