FLINT, Mich. _ Top negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Automobile Workers union disagreed Thursday on the likelihood of a settlement by Monday in the most expensive strike to hit GM in a generation. 

 In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, and Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a settlement before the automaker's two-week summer shutdown ended Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly. 

 ``I would be absolutely shocked'' if the strike was settled by Monday, said Shoemaker, who tried to rein in some of the speculation about an imminent settlement in the walkout, which has idled 26 of GM's 29 North American assembly plants. 

 But a more optimistic Knechtel said, ``It's very important that we get it done by this weekend, if it's at all possible.'' 

 Neither side would specify the issues standing in the way of an agreement, but people close to the union said the talks were focused on resolving important investment and compensation disputes. 

 Knechtel said it was critical for GM also to resolve lingering strike threats at parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers have already authorized a strike, and in Indianapolis, where a strike-authorization vote is scheduled for Sunday. 

 ``We're trying to get them all done,'' he said, declining to say whether GM is seeking a no-strike guarantee regarding those plants. Shoemaker said the union would prefer to focus only on the strikes at two plants here because adding the other disputes would only prolong the process. 

 Among major remaining issues for the union, officials close to the discussions said, is whether the 9,200 striking workers here and the 161,000 workers laid off in the dispute will be granted 32 hours of vacation pay and a week off sometime later in the year. 

 Those are benefits they would have normally received as part of the company's annual two-week shutdown. They are thought to be protected by language in the national contract, according to one senior union official. 

 ``We won't leave here without an agreement on that issue,'' he said. 

 People close to the talks said the union also wanted a formal time line for when GM will invest the remaining $180 million of a $300 million investment plan at the metal-stamping plant, where the first strike began on June 5. The company has said it scaled back investment in the plant because the union failed to help rid the factory of inefficient work rules. 

 At the Delphi East spark plug and speedometer factory, the other plant on strike here, the two sides were still at an impasse over GM's plan to send work to outside sources, a move that the union contended would cut at least 2,500 jobs. 

 UAW officials said negotiators at both plants had resolved many of the hundreds of worker-safety grievances that centered on issues such as exposure to hazardous materials, noise levels and use of old equipment. These people, while declining to specify how those disputes were settled, said the union had begun to look for places to hold ratification meetings once an overall agreement was reached. 

 Early in the day, Shoemaker denied reports that progress was being stymied by demands from GM that broader issues such as what to do with its auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems. 

 ``We have not had a conversation about that,'' Shoemaker said. 

 Delphi employs 50,000 UAW members but lags behind rival auto suppliers in profitability because its wages are more than double the typical pay for parts assembly work. GM and the UAW reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public offering. 

 Industry analysts said the press for a settlement was on because GM needed to begin to make up some of its losses, which are calculated at $1.18 billion through June 30, before the strikes have a chance to dent its third-quarter results. 

 ``If GM doesn't settle this strike in the next couple of days,'' said David Healy, an auto analysts with Burnham Securities, ``whatever they've lost, they lose for good.'' &QL;
