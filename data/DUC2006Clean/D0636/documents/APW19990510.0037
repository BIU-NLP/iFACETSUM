TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the auto-parts manufacturer soon to be independent from General Motors Corp., has no more money-losing plants, is getting cooperation from its unions to cut costs and is winning more non-GM business, its chairman said Monday. 

 As the world's largest parts-maker, Delphi also plans to be a major player in the industry's consolidation through an aggressive acquisition drive, J.T. Battenberg III told reporters before departing on a worldwide roadshow to raise his company's profile among investors. 

 Delphi was once a disparate collection of parts operations that, with parent GM, was near bankruptcy in the early 1990s. Though it lost $93 million last year because of several one-time costs, Delphi earned $284 million in the first quarter this year. 

 GM is cutting Delphi loose to focus on its core business: building cars and trucks. Delphi executives say they expect their business to grow as other automakers no longer have to fear working with a supplier owned by their biggest competitor. 

 There's evidence that's already happening, even though the spinoff won't be completed until May 28. In the first quarter, Delphi won $4 billion in new contracts with GM and a surprising $2 billion worth of non-GM contracts. Delphi stock price increased 18 percent in its first three months. 

 ``The stock has performed well,'' said analyst Jonathan Lawrence of Bear, Stearns & Co. ``They're certainly winning business, and that's picked up since their announcement of the spinoff.''

 Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., and Battenberg will face their first big test come summer when they will work out details of a new contract with the company's largest union, the United Auto Workers. Talks already are under way with some UAW locals and Battenberg said there has been progress. 

 UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million. Both companies are trying to repair their long-contentious relationship with the union. 

 Battenberg declined to comment in detail on that relationship but said he was in ``personal touch'' with UAW leaders. Though company insiders say UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has been cooperative, publicly he has criticized the spinoff and urged GM to retain 51 percent of the company. 

 The Delphi-UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG. The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi's hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM's hourly workers. 

 Delphi no longer has any plants that are unprofitable, in some cases because its unions agreed to relax restrictive work rules, Battenberg said. In Kokomo, Ind., for example, the UAW agreed to work rule changes to allow the electronics plant to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

 Battenberg said Delphi plans to focus on acquiring companies that can supply future technology, especially in the area of high-tech electronics as computers and satellite telecommunications become more integrated into the design of car and truck interiors. 

 ``I look at Delphi becoming an electronics company that makes products for vehicles, which is a lot more attractive than a traditional auto-parts company,'' Lawrence said. 

 Though Delphi has been trimming its work force through attrition, the company may end up adding workers if it meets its goals to increase new business, Battenberg said. 

 Later this month, Delphi will debut a $1 million TV-and-print advertising campaign to coincide with the Indianapolis 500 auto race. The campaign and 20-city roadshow are intended to make Delphi a brand known outside the auto industry.
