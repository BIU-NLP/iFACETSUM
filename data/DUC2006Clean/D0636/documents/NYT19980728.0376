DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers on Tuesday reached tentative agreements that could end two paralyzing strikes in Michigan and prevent two Dayton brake factories from being sold or closed before 2000. 

 The Flint strikes have crippled the world's largest automaker for 54 days, idling 200,000 workers nationwide and nearly half of GM's Dayton-area work force of 20,000. 

 About 9,200 strikers at the two Flint parts plants will vote on the proposed agreements today, UAW officials said. If they approve a settlement, the Flint workers could begin returning to their jobs late tonight. Analysts believe local workers idled by the strikes could return to other area GM plants in Dayton, Kettering, Moraine and Vandalia early next week. 

 The comprehensive settlement that includes the plants in Flint, Dayton and Indianapolis means GM will likely not face more crippling strikes this summer. GM officials were pushing for a comprehensive deal throughout the negotiations. 

 Ratified settlements in Flint would end GM's longest walkout since 1970. The dispute forced GM to shut down 27 of 29 North American assembly plants and cost the automaker close to $3 billion, analysts said. 

 ``I hope in the future that the UAW and GM can sit down and find a different way of doing things, as we do with other automakers,'' said UAW president Stephen Yokich. 

 In Dayton, GM pledged not to sell or close two troubled Delphi brake plants, which employ 3,400 workers, until at least January 2000, said sources close to the Dayton plants. In return, UAW Local 696 agreed not to organize a strike against the automaker during the same time period. The International UAW will seek to extend the no-close-or-sale pledge in national contract talks, and in return, possibly agree to a four-year contract instead of the usual three-year deal. 

 But a source familiar with the Dayton agreement said GM was unable to eliminate a quota clause that requires workers to produce a certain number of parts in an 8-hour workday. Workers sometimes complete the work in five or six hours, but get paid for a full shift. Because of the quota clause, the brake plants have the lowest productivity rating among any of GM's parts plants, company officials said. 

 ``The agreement in Dayton secures jobs until 2000,'' said Gary Hill, president of Local 696. ``The plant (on Wisconsin Boulevard) has been here for 59 years and I'd like to see it around for another 59 years.'' 

 The Dayton dispute was the last obstacle to a comprehensive settlement on Tuesday, said union officials in Flint. UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker and GM officials in Dayton said the agreement includes ``a framework'' to improve the competitiveness of the brake plants. 

 ``Now we must begin working together with the union and all of our employees to address the significant competitive challenges that these plants continue to face,'' said Gerald T. Meier, director of operations for the brake plants. 

 Despite the local agreement, the brake plants still face a gloomy long-term future unless the union and company can overcome massive financial losses. The plants, located on Needmore Road and Wisconsin Boulevard, have lost more than $40 million in the past two years. 

 ``I don't see any change from general trends that affect the U.S. auto industry, said Steve Dandaneau, a labor expert at the University of Dayton. ``It remains a bleak outlook for auto workers and the union, and a strong one for the company.'' 

 Dandaneau said the strikes didn't solve the core problems facing the union. 

 ``It displaces the same conflicts into the future,'' he said. ``If anything, it wore down the workers a bit. It strengthened the resolve of Wall Street and (GM) executives to take drastic action in the future.'' 

 Assuming ratification in Flint, GM's attention will turn to catching up on production of 600,000 cars and trucks canceled by the strike-related parts shortage. Analysts said GM probably will be able to make up only about two-thirds of the shortfall, or about 400,000 units. 

 It will take about a week or two to get all the assembly plants producing again, said Mike Robinet, an auto industry consultant with CSM Corp. in Farmington Hills, Michigan. 

 The company said last month it expects July sales to fall as much as 40 percent below the year-earlier period as dealers face short supplies of some models. 

 ``GM will have a killer 1999, since they've got to make up production lost during the strike,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.

 Lobaccaro estimates the strikes will cost GM $3 billion in lost profit by the time production gets up to speed. That includes $1.2 billion in lost second-quarter profit the company has already accounted for. 

 Assembly plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico could resume production within 10 days and begin months of heavy overtime to fill back orders. More than 15,000 idled workers at GM suppliers also could return to work soon. 

 While details weren't released of the pacts in Flint, some elements of the agreement emerged from company and union officials. 

 The UAW pledged to boost productivity and GM said it would invest in the Flint Metal Center, where 3,400 workers have been on strike. The plant makes truck hoods, fenders and metal cradles that attach engines to frames. 

 GM also pledged not to sell the other Flint plant that is on strike. The dispute was in its 54th day, the longest walkout against the automaker since a 67-day national UAW walkout in 1970. The Flint strikes, however, are more costly, and solidify the central Michigan city's place in GM labor lore. It was in Flint in 1937 that sit-down strikes first led GM to recognize the UAW. The Flint Metal Center strike began June 5 and was followed by the Delphi East walkout June 11. The disputes centered on the UAW's effort to preserve jobs and GM's effort to shed them to match its shrinking market share and catch more efficient rivals. 

 Negotiations intensified Saturday as GM and the union concluded a four-day binding arbitration hearing with umpire Thomas Roberts. The arbitrator hadn't said when he would rule, but negotiators said both sides were worried about losing. 

 GM had sought the arbitration, alleging that the walkouts were illegal because they concerned national issues such as plant investments. The UAW maintained the strikes were allowable under the contract because they concerned health and safety issues. 

 A break came Saturday, when GM agreed to return metal-stamping tools to the Flint Metal Center. Workers cheered Sunday as the trucks entered the factory. 

 GM had removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend, two weeks before the first strike, in an effort to keep its redesigned Chevrolet and GM pickups on track for fall. The dies are used to form truck body panels. The removal infuriated the UAW, which said it violated the UAW contract and provoked the strike. 

 Talks to resolve the Flint strikes languished for weeks as costs mounted for GM and idled thousands of workers who missed paychecks and depended on unemployment benefits. Strikers receive about $150 in weekly strike benefits. UAW members in the U.S. make about $800 a week, excluding overtime. 

 Most of the Dayton-area workers idled by the Flint trikes are represented by the International Union of Electronic Workers and received about 95 percent of their wages and benefits during the shut down. But about 1,000 UAW members at the Dayton brake plants will find out in about two weeks whether they will receive unemployment for the work they missed. 

 A hearing was held Tuesday in Columbus by the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services to determine if the strike-related layoffs are due to a labor dispute or a lack of work as the result of a parts shortage, said OBES spokesman David Garick. 

 If the state finds a parts shortage triggered layoffs, the local workers could be eligible for checks in about two weeks at the earliest, Garick said.
