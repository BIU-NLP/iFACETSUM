DETROIT _ Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories have left the United Automobile Workers union and GM fighting over whether the auto maker is pursuing an ``America Last'' strategy, but the reality lies somewhere in between their positions. 

 The UAW is accusing the General Motors Corp. of spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories. GM has responded by publicizing what it calls plans to invest $21 billion in the United States by 2001. 

 The company's financial statements and projections show that its investments in the United States are substantial _ but that the amount invested annually will not increase in coming years and may actually decline. GM's annual investments overseas are rising. 

 With few signs of progress toward resolving the strikes that began June 5, the union raised the prospect Monday that the walkouts could last into mid-August, which would make it the most serious strike against the company since 1970. GM executives have made no secret that they think the best long-term opportunities now in the global auto industry lie in countries such as Brazil and China where adults still outnumber cars, unlike in the United States. But in the last two weeks they have also been promoting their U.S. investment plans. The $21 billion figure GM uses works out to an average of $4.2 billion a year. 

 ``I'm unaware of any other company making that kind of investment in the United States,'' Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said last week. Most big companies do not disclose their investment plans, but Hackworth's assertion is plausible because G.M. is the nation's biggest company and it operates in a heavy-investment industry. 

 But notes at the back of GM's annual report show that GM invested $5.39 billion last year in North America automotive operations and $5.18 billion in 1996. These figures include relatively small investments in Mexico and Canada, although GM refused to provide exact figures. 

 Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman, said the annual amount of GM's car-building investments in the United States would stay flat or decline slightly in the coming years. But he said that these investments remained a majority of GM's planned investments worldwide in building cars. The level of investments is also not important, Holmes said, because GM has been working to make its investments more efficient. 

 ``It's not indicative that we're doing less _ we're doing more with less,'' he said. 

 GM officials have consistently refused to provide figures for GM's future investments overseas, but they totaled $2.45 billion last year and are expected to grow. GM is building new assembly plants in Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Thailand and China. GM also announced Monday that it would invest another $100 million in its joint venture in China. By contrast, GM has not committed itself to building any new factories in the United States, where it still has more assembly plants than can be justified by its market share, which has been shrinking for more than 20 years. 

 Hackworth said in an interview last week that GM might cut back even its current investment plans in the United States if the UAW did not heed the company's demands for labor peace and more flexible work rules in factories. 

 ``Strikes and noncompetitive work practices jeopardize that investment,'' Hackworth said. 

 He said that the main issue in the strikes at two parts factories in Flint, Mich., was not where GM builds factories but rather the insistence of some workers there on collecting eight hours' pay for only four to six hours of work. 

 UAW officials have said that they are willing to change work rules in Flint, but only if GM follows through on a promise to invest another $180 million in one of the parts factories on strike there. UAW officials had no immediate comment when told Monday evening that GM's investments in the United States would show no year-over-year increase and would likely decline. 

 GM's claim to be putting a majority of its investments in the United States also comes with a qualifier: All of its investment calculations, including the $21 billion figure, are for GM's car-building operations only, and exclude Delphi Automotive Systems, GM's large auto parts subsidiary. Delphi, with $1.26 billion in worldwide investment last year, has been the most aggressive of GM's units in building new factories in Mexico and overseas while selling or closing them in the United States. 

 GM has also chosen to focus on investment rather than jobs as the measure of commitment to the United States. But GM investments in the United States are mostly in costly operations like new assembly plant equipment, which preserves a few high-paying jobs for highly skilled workers. GM's investments abroad tend to be parts factories that cost little to build but can employ thousands of low-skilled workers. 

 The UAW appears to be preparing members for a protracted struggle this summer. Stephen Yokich, the union's president, said Monday at the opening of a union convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that the union would ``last one day longer'' than GM in the current showdown. 

 Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, warned Monday at the convention that if no deal was reached this week, the strike could last until mid-August. GM needs to begin mass production of its 1999 models then and will be under considerable pressure to compromise. 

 GM's factories have long been scheduled to close at the end of this week for the company's annual two-week summer vacation. Union officials want to end the strike before then so that workers will be entitled to full vacation pay. 

 GM said that it had closed 24 of its 29 assembly plants, including one in Ste. Therese, Quebec, that shut down Monday. The strike has idled 122,400 GM workers across North America, while outside suppliers have also laid off thousands of workers temporarily.
