DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co. reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new contract, hours after a handful of workers walked off the job when a strike deadline passed. 

 A joint statement announcing the deal contained no details, and officials declined to provide any, pending ratification meetings. 

 A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement followed the pattern set by the UAW in deals with General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year agreements with raises of 3 percent each year and a signing bonus. 

 It was unknown how the contract dealt with Visteon Automotive Systems, the parts division of Ford that the company is expected to either spin-off or sell. 

 UAW officials have said they were opposed to the company's plans for Visteon, which employs 23,500 UAW workers. Officials were concerned a separate Visteon could cut pay and jobs and even close plants to compete against other parts companies. 

 The strike deadline of midnight Friday was a first in U.S. auto industry negotiations this year and a sign of strain in what had been billed as a close relationship. 

 However, the union said it did not authorize any work stoppages and workers at only a handful of plants walked off their jobs when the deadline passed. Plants scheduled to operate on Saturday were back in business by the day shift. 

 The temporary walkout was designed to be ``kind of like a wake-up call'' to Ford, said Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 in St. Louis. 

 The walkouts came at Ford plants in St. Louis; Claycomo, Mo.; Flat Rock, Mich.; and St. Paul, Minn. There was no word on how many workers were involved. 

 Ford had made $6.6 billion in 1998, thanks to a lack of work stoppages and bulked-up production at truck and sport utility vehicle plants. The average worker's profit sharing payment was $6,100. 

 There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees. 

 During a Labor Day parade in Detroit, UAW workers carried signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' -- an orange monster busting out of the Ford logo. 

 And UAW President Stephen P.Yokich told union members in a taped message earlier in the week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler. 

 The UAW negotiated some terms with DaimlerChrysler, GM and Delphi Automotive Systems that experts say could have applied to Ford and Visteon. The contracts included promises from the companies that they would not spin off, sell or close any division or factory. 

 The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 with a GM pension. Other terms include a $1,350 signing bonus, improved pensions and better cost-of-living adjustments. 

 GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on their new contract by next week. 

 The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976; it was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations. A local union in Atlanta struck Ford in 1986. The UAW has not held a national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut down most of the company's North American production.
