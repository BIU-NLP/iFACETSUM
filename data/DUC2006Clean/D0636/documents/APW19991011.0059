DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers got more money and security for four years. The automakers got the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers. 

 And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry. 

 All in all, contract negotiations between the union and General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and DaimlerChrysler AG were quick and peaceful. 

 ``The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations. 

 As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said Monday. ``They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well.'' 

 The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments. 

 According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal. Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement reached Saturday. 

 The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000. The figure for GM is not available. 

 The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling off or closing factories or parts of their businesses. 

 All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998. Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. in New York said the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits. 

 But automakers might win that increase back and even save some costs by cutting jobs through retirement. 

 The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies. With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, automakers rely on retirement to shed workers. The average UAW autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be eligible for retirement in five years. 

 The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many replacements must be hired to offset retirements. When retirements are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to replace one out of every three retirees. 

 Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would have to replace every additional retiree. 

 And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring instead to fill their needs with overtime. Last year, GM added 500 hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week. 

 ``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis said. 

 The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company. Visteon's current workers would remain Ford employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW. 

 UAW officials had opposed a spinoff or sale of Visteon, fearing it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay. 

 ``The fact remains there will likely be a spinoff, and this could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be sustained,'' Merlis said. 

 The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week. Ford local union officials will hear details of their contract Wednesday.
