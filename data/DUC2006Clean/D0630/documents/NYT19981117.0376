The flat, sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away from a New York literary lunch and repartee with a prominent author, but this prosaic side of the nation's $8 billion consumer book market _ packing, shipping and delivery _ has become a key to its future. 

 With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go. 

 The announcement this month that the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes & Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.

 There is a basic explanation for the dazzle of distribution. With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions. Such top booksellers as Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com are looking for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by sending more of their orders through their own distribution centers.

 For consumers, this means that delivery will become swifter, setting a standard of 24-hour service for online bookstores, but also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by stores on terra firma. 

 While top publishers troll for new alliances to share distribution, regional distributors are on a spree of buying smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure a customer base. Daily there is speculation that Amazon.com, the e-commerce pioneer, is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own. 

 Meanwhile, the Yankee Group, a technology research organization, forecasts that online sales of books will climb to $700 million by the end of this year. 

 Worried that they will be left by the wayside, restive independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes & Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into their records.

 ``They'll be able to find out what our sales are, what the profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores are and then move in,'' said William Petrocelli, the co-owner of Book Passage, an independent store in Corte Madera, Calif., just north of San Francisco. He is circulating a letter among booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators. 

 The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers, including four new ones in Nashville. Last week it also announced the hiring of a new chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, who, when he was chief executive of Ingram Distribution Group, presided over the expansion of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade books in the world. The book and distribution groups are both owned by Ingram Industries. 

 ``We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset, but frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition didn't pay much attention to it,'' said Robert F. DiRomualdo, chairman of the Borders Group. ``We've got to become more efficient as an industry, so I'm not surprised that everyone is moving in that direction.'' 

 Barnes & Noble's purchase of Ingram is just the most visible example of the industry shift. According to several top publishing executives, Amazon.com had also been talking with Nashville-based Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker & Taylor, the No. 2 wholesaler, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., and has 5 distribution sites to Ingram's 11.

 In response to such speculation, Baker & Taylor president James Ulsamer said, ``Anyone at the right time at the right price is for sale.'' But he added, ``There is nothing in the works.''

 Amazon was just as cryptic. ``We neither confirm nor deny rumors, speculation or chitchat about what we may be or may not be doing,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman. 

 One top publishing executive said Amazon had moved to cut its ties with Ingram, but John Ingram, chairman of Ingram Book Group, said that to his knowledge no such break had occurred. 

 Last week he sent out more than 5,000 letters to independent booksellers urging them to trust in the company's history of integrity and commitment to treat all customers equally. ``We've never shared information,'' Ingram said. ``I wouldn't have done the deal without those assurances. Ingram people will continue to run our business with the same high degree of integrity as we've always done. Barnes & Noble would expect nothing less.''

 Barnes & Noble chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said his company would ``never, ever'' ask for information from Ingram about a competitor. ``From my point of view, we're actually rooting for them and every other good bookstore in America,'' he said, noting that his company needed the support of other booksellers for Ingram to grow. ``We don't see this as a Darwinian struggle. So we see our interests lining up with them.''

 It is unlikely that many booksellers will break with the company as they approach Christmas, their busiest and most profitable season. But Ingram's pledge gives little comfort to the American Booksellers Association, which is deeply distrustful of Barnes & Noble and has sued the company in San Francisco, accusing it of unfair trade practices. ``I'm having a difficult time finding solace,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the trade group. ``It's like putting the fox in the henhouse and taking his word that he's not going to eat the chickens.''

 Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent booksellers, said Albert Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham University who follows publishing, Barnes & Noble's move was born out of its need to remain competitive in ``the face of potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators, which will transform the selling of books.''

 Most publishers and distributors are already proceeding as if the Barnes & Noble purchase is a fait accompli, yet antitrust lawyers and even Wall Street analysts are more cautious about how federal regulators will regard the deal. They predict that it will probably take much longer for the purchase to be approved than the 30 to 45 days foreseen by Barnes & Noble executives.

 Pearson PLC's purchase of Simon & Schuster's education division, announced in May, remains tied up in a second round of review by the Justice Department, although the company keeps saying approval could come any day.

 ``We think the deal was expensive and may be difficult to close because of regulatory concerns,'' Danielle Turnoff Fox, an analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities, said of the Ingram acquisition. Ms. Fox said that unless Barnes & Noble set up some system of fire walls, as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive information about Amazon.com's actual unit sales of books online. ``There are competitive issues that are likely to come under intense scrutiny,'' she added.

 J. Michael Cooper, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust cases at the Washington firm Bryan Cave, said the Federal Trade Commission would be likely to review the deal because of its experience analyzing other mergers in the book industry. ``If there are any real issues when they do their first look, this could take some time,'' he said, adding that he expected the Ingram purchase to face a second round of intensive review that could take up to six months. 

 Meantime, others in the industry are sizing up ways they can use distribution to overcome sluggish growth. Last year, sales of consumer, or popular, books grew only 1 percent from 1996, which means they did not even keep pace with population growth. 

 During the summer, Time Warner's trade book division and HarperCollins, which is owned by News Corp. were in talks about forming a joint distribution network, but they failed to come to an agreement, said two top publishing executives who insisted on anonymity. This month, Random House Inc., now owned by Bertelsmann AG, announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its book distribution center in Westminster, Md., while also setting a date to close its warehouse in Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago. After opening a $30 million center near Charlottesville, Va., last year, the German media conglomerate Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck is still in the process of adding its publishing houses to the network. 

 While publishers strive to streamline distribution networks, regional distributors that serve independent publishers have in turn started buying up some of those publishing houses, partly to secure their customer base and to spread the costs of back-office functions. Two leading distributors, Publishers Group West in California and the National Book Network in Maryland, are buying heavily these days. 

 ``We're looking at perhaps three or four different deals,'' said Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, which in the last three years has acquired four publishers through its parent company, Publishers Group Inc. ``Right now I have eight different prospectuses sitting on my desk. It's amazing how much activity there is.'' He said he expected to double revenue from its publishing companies to nearly $20 million within 12 months. 

 The pace of change has been dizzying to publishers, booksellers and distributors, who talk about these recent shifts and the spate of mergers and consolidations as a sea change in the industry. 

 ``The whole process has sped up dramatically,'' said National Book Network president Jed Lyons. ``In the past, it would take maybe two or three weeks and the book would arrive. Today consumers aren't willing to wait two or three weeks. They want it tomorrow.''
