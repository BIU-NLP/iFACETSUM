``You've Got Mail'' is an enticing first kiss of a film, with stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as irresistible as free puppies outside a store and New York City looking like a flower-bedecked nirvana, which is why audiences are falling hard for this season's most popular romantic comedy. 

 But there is one group of people who watch ``You've Got Mail'' and see something other than Hollywood romance. Never mind the ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' romantics of Nora Ephron's film. Independent booksellers focus more on the movie's subplot and feel as though they are watching their own funeral. 

 Because ``You've Got Mail'' is the first popular entertainment to focus on the plight of embattled independent booksellers as they try to survive the tidal wave of chain superstores (Barnes & Noble, Borders) along with such online competitors as Seattle-based Amazon.com.

 It is a tense battle that has involved not only a war of words, but also lawsuits as independent booksellers have taken their case to court, alleging that chain superstores have engaged in unfair trade practices and extracted favoritism from publishers. 

 The chains still march on. In six years, independent booksellers have gone from selling one-third of the books in this country to half that percentage and many beloved independents have closed, including the recent demise of the Printers Inc. bookstore in Palo Alto, Calif. 

 So while other viewers feel a tug at their heartstrings as the Ryan and Hanks characters perform their wise-cracking mating ritual, booksellers brush away tears as the adorable little children's bookstore run by Ryan's character (Kathleen Kelly) is imperiled by a chain superstore run by Hanks' character (Joe Fox). 

 The fictional Fox & Sons Books (carbon copy of a Barnes & Noble) muscles its way into the same Manhattan neighborhood, offering it trademark mix of what Fox laughing describes as ``cheap books and legal addictive stimulants.'' And in about six months, a sign goes up on the front door of The Shop Around the Corner, which was started by Kelly's mother and had been in the family ever since.

 ``After 42 years,'' the sign announces, ``we are closing. We have loved being a part of your lives.'' 

 ``The movie made me feel very sad about what is happening in our business,'' admits Carol Santaro, co-owner of the Fremont Place bookstore in Seattle. ``We were both thankful the film brings out these issues, especially for those who might not be aware.'' 

 ```You've Got Mail' does portray many of the problems for independent bookstores in this country,'' says Paul Hanson, manager of Eagle Harbor Book Co. on Bainbridge Island, Wash. ``Meg Ryan's bookstore did close in the movie and that's the plight of a lot of bookstores these days.'' 

 The bookselling duel in the film _ which representatives at Barnes & Noble's headquarters in New York City declined to discuss _ is perhaps nowhere better mirrored in the Seattle area than in the bustling environs of University Village shopping center.

 There, a two-level Barnes & Noble superstore, already having supplanted the long-established Kay's Bookmark, draws a steady crowd of customers, who stroll through its wide aisles and sprawl in its overstuffed chairs as the upbeat elevator music of ``Guantanamera'' plays over loudspeakers.

 The upstairs children's section at Barnes & Noble is a showcase of big bucks being spent to attract little customers (and their parents), with huge cardboard cutouts of favorite characters from children's books, as well as tiny tables and stools and some kid Adirondack chairs. From the picture windows in the department can be seen University Village shops and parking lots and not far beyond them, a bright blue shape. It turns out to be the awning on the front of a small bookstore for children _ All for Kids Books and Music.

 Inside, owner Chauni Haslet presides over a thriving independent of 4,000 square feet that sprawls through several rooms of varying shapes and sizes. It is a homespun, handwritten notes, crazy quilt kind of place. 

 Haslet's attitude mirrors that of Ryan's character in the film. While Kelly derides her chain-store competition as a ``theme park, multilevel mocha-cino land,'' Haslet simply refers to hers by its initials, which she jokes stand for ``Big & Nasty.''

 ```You've Got Mail' is remarkably true, although it is unfortunate that Tom Hanks makes the big guys look really lovable,'' Haslet says. ``That's not the sense I have of the big guys.'' 

 The 54-year-old bookstore owner is not just spouting off. She has already felt the muscle of the chains, closing a second location in suburban Issaquah when a Barnes & Noble was opening there (one of several factors in the closing). She decided to concentrate all her energies on the University District store, moving aggressively to continue its success.

 She expanded All for Kids into an adjoining storefront and hosted a series of daily events for four months prior to the opening at Barnes & Noble. These measures were intended to draw traffic, convey properousness and foster customer loyalty.

 All for Kids, already chock-full of products related to kid books (from plush characters to music to art), even added a section of adult books (all read and recommended by staffers) as a kind of living memorial to the defunct Kay's Bookmark. All for Kids may indeed be the only children's bookstore in the country to stock a novel by Thomas Pynchon. 

 ``We knew that if we had stayed small, not as visible, with not as much window space, we would not be in existence,'' says Haslet, who has 16 years' experience in the book business. ``Any time an independent sees a chain coming and does not make adjustments, they're in trouble.'' 

 That is exactly what happened to The Shop Around the Corner in ``You've Got Mail.'' Kelly counts on her customers' loyalty, but sales continue to plummet each day that Fox Books is open. Even a blitz of favorable media coverage about the little store's plight _ a battle depicted as ``Joan of Arc against Attila the Hun'' _ cannot stem the bleeding of red ink. 

 After the frantic going-out-of-business sale, Kelly returns to the shop one last time and surveys its empty shelves. She admits, ``I feel as if a part of me has died. I feel the way I did when my mother died all over again and no one can make it right.'' 

 Independent booksellers hope that sympathy for The Shop Around the Corner will be transferred to their own stores. The American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., distributed free movie tickets to booksellers in major cities and sent special ``You've Got Mail'' posters to its members, posters that included the additional lines: ``Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds'' and ``Visit the shop around YOUR corner.'' 

 As Len Vlahos, spokesman for the 3,300-member association, stresses, ``The movie has done what we anticipated _ it raises issues about independent bookstores that many people in the public may never have considered. So this helps, whether we happen to agree with how things are depicted in this Hollywood film. It raises consciousness and gets people talking, so we felt that our members needed to be connected to `You've Got Mail.''' 

 The connection is already paying some dividends at small independents in the Seattle area. Booksellers may complain that The Shop Around the Corner is too cute to be real, and that Kelly starts a new career much too easily after her store closes. 

 But those complaints have been muted by real customers who have come into their real stores, bought books and expressed support because of having seen the film. 

 It is only a trickle of customers, thus far, but independent booksellers are grateful for any encouragement they can get these days.
