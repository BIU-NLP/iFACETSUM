SEATTLE (AP) -- Sandwiched between coffee bars and vintage clothing shops, the Fremont Place Book Co. has provided the city's hip, young Fremont neighborhood with everything from obscure titles to bestsellers for more than a decade. 

 But a sign in the window warns of an uncertain future: ``This bookstore is endangered.'' 

 The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles. The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes & Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co., the world's largest book distributor.

 For independent booksellers, the $600 million deal is the last straw. 

 ``We were all just aghast when we heard about the deal,'' says Carol Santoro, co-owner of Fremont Place. ``It's becoming more and more of a dynasty.'' 

 Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes & Noble to learn what others are buying. Santoro has responded by shifting orders to other suppliers.

 But independent booksellers are not the only ones worried about self-preservation in a changing industry. Even a giant in the business like Ingram says it cannot overlook the impact of chain stores and online retailers in the market. 

 Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002. 

 At the urging of several members of Congress, including Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and independent booksellers, the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the deal between Ingram and Barnes & Noble. The state attorney general in California -- home to many independent booksellers -- also is investigating.

 Wyden took up the cause because of personal exposure to the tough circumstances facing small booksellers. His father was an author and ran his own publishing house for some years. 

 ``I was raised being skeptical about what is happening in the bookselling business,'' Wyden said. 

 He supports conditions to the merger so all booksellers have equal access to published material. He also favors ``firewalls'' to prevent information sharing. Without such conditions, Wyden believes the deal could be the death of the small stores. 

 ``I think this really is a survival issue for them,'' Wyden said. 

 Independent bookstores have been on the offensive since the dawn of the mega bookstore, when giants like Borders and Barnes & Noble opened up triple decker shops stocked with thousands of book titles, CDs and even cappuccino bars. Because of their high volume, these stores were able to slash prices.

 Then came Amazon.com. 

 The online retail giant has revolutionized the market, enabling shoppers to buy, send and special-order books with a click of the mouse. 

 In March, the American Booksellers Association and other independent bookstores filed suit against the two retail book chains, saying they have used their clout to secure illegal deals and preferential treatment from publishing houses. Another suit filed by independent booksellers in August also names Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com. 

 The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes & Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and reduce the diversity of materials.

 ``You wind up with a smaller and smaller group of people deciding who to publish,'' said Len Vlahos of the ABA, based in Tarrytown, N.Y. 

 While there will always be the John Grishams and other big moneymakers, bookstores also need to make room for lesser known names. 

 ``You like to think artistic content matters,'' says Santoro. ``Not just the bottom line.'' 

 Ingram says it is reaching out to its clients to assure them of confidentiality in their transactions. Predictions that the merger will reduce the variety of books available are just not true, says Mary Ellen Keating of Barnes & Noble.

 ``We are going to make every book available,'' she said. 

 But Wyden says independent bookstores do more than just sell books, and often function as community centers. 

 ``The small stores help make rural life more vibrant,'' Wyden said. 

 Patrons agree. 

 ``There's just a flavor that you're looking for,'' said Diane Kerner of Seattle, making her purchases at Fremont Place one rainy morning. ``People love their neighborhood bookstores.''
