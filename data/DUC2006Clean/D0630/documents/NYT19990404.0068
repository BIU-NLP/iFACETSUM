Five months after Barnes & Noble Inc. rattled the book industry with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation's largest wholesaler, Ingram Book Group, the proposed merger is undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated by the California attorney general's office.

 When the $600 million purchase was announced in early November, Barnes & Noble's top executives confidently predicted that the merger of the nation's largest bookseller and wholesaler would be completed in 35 to 45 days, but the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust review has lingered longer than expected.

 Independent booksellers, meanwhile, have organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry, with so many petitions, e-mails and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency has set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal. (``If your call is in reference to the proposed Barnes & Noble-Ingram merger, please press one,'' its voice-mail system tells callers.)

 Barnes & Noble's acquisition of Ingram, a unit of Ingram Industries, is undergoing a level of scrutiny from the FTC that is known as a ``second request review,'' in general a rare move that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.

 The length and type of the review does not necessarily mean the merger is in deep trouble. Other recent book industry deals have faced intense reviews from Federal regulators but still were eventually approved. 

 The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon & Schuster's education unit, which was ultimately approved. Bertelsmann AG's successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.

 The Ingram deal has galvanized strong opposition from booksellers in California. There, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said Friday that the agency was reviewing the deal. ``We're investigating,'' said the spokeswoman Sandra Michioku, the director of public affairs for the attorney general, Bill Lockyer. ``The process is to look at what would be the impact of the merger and to make a decision whether it's anticompetitive.'' 

 Even if the FTC approves the merger, California can ask a federal judge to block it, said Ms. Michioku, who declined to comment on what prompted the state to get involved. She said she knew of no other state that was investigating the merger. 

 The Connecticut attorney general's office is monitoring the FTC review, although it is not conducting one itself. 

 Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble in New York, said the company was not aware of the California investigation, although it did receive a letter from the state requesting information that the bookstore chain was providing to Federal investigators.

 ``It's really not uncommon for a state attorney general to be interested in a transaction like this, because there have been concerns raised about this,'' Ms. Keating said. She noted that the company was ``confident that this acquisition will be approved.'' 

 In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Barnes & Noble's chairman and chief executive, Leonard Riggio, said that he expected a decision by the FTC in 60 to 90 days, which would be sometime in June.

 Ingram, based in Nashville, is the dominant force in book distribution. Privately held, it does not disclose its market share. Barnes & Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.

 In general, the merger's opponents are worried that the Ingram purchase will give Barnes & Noble access to the sales data of independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with popular books that might be in short supply while making a competitor like Amazon.com wait for the same title.

 After the many recent mergers in the book industry, some opponents of the Barnes & Noble-Ingram deal said they believed it was getting more serious attention because they were being asked by the FTC to provide formal declarations of opposition. The agency declined to comment on the status of its review.

 ``This is the first time that we've been asked for declarations, and nothing like this has happened before with the struggle with Simon & Schuster and Bertelsmann and Random House,'' said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the president of the Authors Guild in New York, which challenged the other mergers.

 J. Michael Cooper, a Washington antitrust specialist who is not involved in the case, said the request for declarations indicated that the federal review had reached a new level. 

 ``It suggests that they did reach a stage where they have problems and they are willing to go ahead and seek a preliminary injunction,'' Cooper said. ``I think that they have problems and they're trying to work those out.'' 

 He noted that declarations are normally collected in preparation for an injunction request or for use in persuading FTC commissioners to block a merger. 

 Some opponents of the merger took comfort from Ingram's announcement in March of a stategic alliance with Entertainment Marketing Information Services. 

 Through its Book Scan unit, EMIS will take over the collection of sales data from independent bookstores that were previously polled by Ingram. 

 This move, in the opponents' view, represents an effort to address the concern that Ingram might pass along information about independent booksellers to Barnes & Noble.

 Led by the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., independent booksellers have conducted a letter-writing campaign against the merger that has delivered the signatures of more than 115,000 book buyers to the FTC. 

 The independent booksellers also have held meetings with elected officials, which have resulted in letters from officials like Sen. Michael DeWine, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, urging the federal agency to review the merger closely. 

 The City Council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a resolution supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the merger. 

 In San Francisco, a long-distance telephone and credit card company, Working Assets, organized a telephone campaign by its customers that resulted in 35,000 calls to the FTC to oppose the merger, according to Janet Nudelman, a director at the company. 

 ``Booksellers are not a particularly political group of folks,'' said Oren Teicher, who has been organizing the opposition for the American Booksellers Association. ``They tend not to be involved in this kind of lobbying. But in this case we have found the inverse to be true. Booksellers are enormously responsive.''
