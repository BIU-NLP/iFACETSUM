LOS ANGELES _ There was no new John Grisham, no new Anne Rice, no new Tom Wolfe either. But there was, thank goodness, a new Michael Crichton, a new Scott Turow, a new William Least Heat-Moon, plus Frank McCourt's eagerly anticipated sequel to ``Angela's Ashes'' and Thomas Harris' long-awaited sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' 

 So as the country's independent booksellers and publishers gathered last weekend for their annual prom _ now called BookExpo America _ there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the selling seasons ahead. Hope, but hardly ecstasy. 

 But then, this is a national convention where the main commodity these days is irony. Major publishers mounted massive displays that filled two halls of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center, but found themselves hawking wares to an ever-diminishing sector of the marketplace. 

 Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain superstores, then Internet purveyors led by Seattle's Amazon.com, so the ``indies'' have seen their portion of the book market cut in half (to 16.6 percent) during this decade and membership in their trade organization drop from 5,200 to 3,500. 

 The convention's first day also included the distressing announcement of a national study that found that, despite a booming economy, sales of books sold to adults dropped 3 percent last year. Chain stores claimed 25 percent of sales, while Internet purveyors (measured for the first time) claimed 2 percent, as indie share continued its decline. 

 Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering about the latest book stores killed in action and, as bookseller John Barrigner of Charlotte, N.C., put it, ``which of our good friends we won't see this year.'' 

 Worries about their fate have reached such a state that booksellers in their official annual meeting portion of the convention found themselves debating whether to censure McCourt, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the country's best-selling authors. The phenomenal success of ``Angela's Ashes'' had paid many bookseller bills since publication, and it had been given an annual prize (the ABBY award) as the book that independents most enjoyed selling. 

 But McCourt had gone on to commit what some independents considered a traitorous act. He had appeared in a TV commercial extolling the virtues of the Web site of Barnes & Noble. So a handful of upstart independents urged a censure of McCourt and a request that he return his ABBY. The motion failed handily Saturday afternoon, but only after a spirited and sometimes heated debate.

 ``I'm not political, I don't know the details of the bookseller war,'' McCourt said the next morning. ``If I had known, I might have thought twice about appearing in that ad. I am in favor of independents, but the big boys sell books, too. A writer's real job is to write books. But if you look at the stores where I appeared on behalf of `Angela's Ashes,' it was probably 15 to 1 in favor of independents. My conscience is clear.'' 

 The McCourt imbroglio was one of the few contentious moments at a convention repeatedly described as ``businesslike.'' It may have been held in the city that defines glitz, but the three-day proceedings had a workmanlike air, perhaps in part because the weather outside the hall was chilly and gray and offered little temptation. 

 Even a cocktail party at the Playboy Mansion to celebrate Grove/Atlantic's upcoming publication of ``The Century of Sex'' _ undoubtedly the weekend's hottest ticket _ seemed deflated by the weather. At poolside, chairman Hugh Hefner looked distinctly chilly in his trademark smoking jacket and silk pajama pants, and the two statuesque Playboy Bunnies in their skimpy costumes seemed in real danger of contracting chest colds. 

 The convention's estimated 29,000 visitors were encouraged by some marketplace moves by the ABA, highlighted by the unveiling of the new Web site BookSense.com, which will allow individual independent stores to have their own customized presence on the Internet. It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and process orders from customers. 

 This may not terrify Amazon.com, but it did excite independents. Throughout the weekend, they crowded around demos of the Web site, expected to be running within six months, and a poster was often updated with the number of BookSense enrollees, up to a robust 865 booksellers by Sunday afternoon. 

 Avin Domnitz, ABA executive director, was ecstatic. 

 ``When we started introducing BookSense at regional meetings, we hoped to come to this convention with 300 stores enrolled so that it would be a legitimate program,'' Domnitz said. ``And we thought that if we left the convention with 500 stores, we would have reached critical mass.'' 

 On the book front, this fall's offerings seemed solid, although no one book seemed to spark the kind of buzz that some books have enjoyed at past conventions. 

 Strong non-fiction titles include memoirs by astronaut John Glenn (Bantam), Sen. John McCain (Random House) and McCourt (Scribner); and biographies of Hillary Clinton by Gail Sheehy (Random House), Jack Dempsey by Roger Kahn (Harcourt Brace) and Nelson Mandela by Anthony Sampson (Knopf). 

 There is also William Least Heat-Moon's river journey across America (Houghton Mifflin); Richard Rhodes' timely examination of why people commit violent crimes (Knopf); John Nathan's inside look at the rise and fall of Sony (Houghton Mifflin); Seattle author Erik Larson's recreation of a 1900 Texas hurricane, ``Isaac's Storm'' (Ballantine); Susan Faludi's look at the plight of the American male, ``Stiffed'' (Morrow); and Michael ``Liar's Poker'' Lewis' Silicon Valley saga, ``The New New Thing'' (Norton). 

 Strong fiction titles include Turow's ``Personal Injuries'' (Farrar Straus), Crichton's ``Timeline'' (Knopf), Claire Messud's ``The Last Life'' (Harcourt Brace), Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's prequel to ``Dune'' titled ``Dune: House Atreides'' (Bantam), and Harris' ``Lambs'' sequel, ``Hannibal'' (Dell). 

 The most eagerly awaited fall children's book, hands down, is the second Harry Potter book by British author J.K. Rowling, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (Scholastic). The already published British edition has prompted an Internet shopping frenzy across borders.
