On the eve of its annual national convention, the bookselling business has never seemed more like a business. 

 In the past 12 months, the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG completed its purchase of Random House, Barnes & Noble Inc. announced it would buy the world's largest wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, and Bertelsmann and Barnes & Noble announced a joint investment in the on-line seller barnesandnoble.com.

 Meanwhile, as big business gets bigger, smaller business simply disappears. Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion. 

 Perhaps a few parties, and some California sun, will make it all go away. Booksellers, publishers, agents and authors are gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center for this year's BookExpo America. The three-day exhibition and trade show, which starts Friday, ends May 2. 

 ``The book business has never been more difficult nor more uncertain than it is now,'' said Richard Howorth, ABA president and owner of Square Books in Oxford, Miss. ``While it's still a wonderful occupation, it's awfully scary.'' 

 In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores. In 1991, independents received 32.5 percent of sales and chains 22 percent.

 Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002. 

 BEA won't turn that around, but for a few days it gives independent sellers a chance to meet, commiserate and plan. One proposed change is to reduce the ABA's board of directors, from 20 to nine. 

 ``We're trying to make the board more responsive, more nimble and able to react quickly,'' said Howorth, ``because everything is changing so fast.'' 

 Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods, independents are fighting back any way they can. The ABA is suing Barnes & Noble and Borders for antitrust violations and is among those opposing the proposed Ingram sale, which the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing. The booksellers association is also creating its own on-line selling site, BookSense.com, scheduled to be ready by late summer.

 ``This is all being done out of necessity. You can't just sit around and be a guy in the shop and think life is going to go on the way it's been,'' Howorth said. 

 Publishers face a problem directly related to the convention: introducing their fall books, their main reason for coming to BookExpo. Because of scheduling conflicts at the Convention Center, this year's meeting will take place a month earlier than usual. Not everyone is ready. 

 ``Frankly, we haven't seen enough of our manuscripts to really feel comfortable,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing for Farrar, Straus & Giroux. ``We're cataloguing books we're not even sure are going to be ready on schedule.''

 But once in Los Angeles, there will be plenty of time for promotions, parties and seminars. And, at least around meal times, the industry will pause and let the writers talk. Featured speakers include Nobelist Elie Wiesel, Pulitzer Prize winners Frank McCourt and Jorie Graham, as well as Robert Stone, Ward Just, David Guterson and Nikki Giovanni. Salman Rushdie, on his first full-fledged book tour since being sentenced to death 10 years ago by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is expected to appear. 

 But Rushdie is likely the only writer who will draw as big a crowd as the weekend's most quotable ``author,'' Bill Murray, the undoubtedly proud papa of ``A Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf.'' 

 Those looking forward to seeing the merry Murray bear-hugging the sad-eyed Wiesel will be disappointed. Murray will not share the dais with Wiesel or any Pulitzer winners. 

 Instead, his fellow breakfast speakers will include Frances Mayes, a California-based poet who writes about Italy, and a celebrity whom Dan Aykroyd, Murray's ``Saturday Night Live'' co-star, once parodied so well, Julia Child. 

 Bon appetit.
