CHICAGO (AP) -- When bookstore owner Michael Powell arrived at BookExpo America his schedule included leading a seminar on electronic publishing. He soon discovered he was the one who needed leading. 

 ''I figured I knew as much as anybody about it,'' Powell said. ''On Wednesday we had the seminar. By Friday, I realized everything I said was wrong. Fortunately, everything everybody else said was wrong, too.'' 

 If you listened carefully the past few days at McCormick Place you could hear the sound of heads being scratched, eyes opening and minds processing it all. BookExpo America, which ended Sunday, both confirmed and continued the rise of digital media in the publishing industry. 

 Lectures and panel discussions on e-books, electronic rights and related issues attracted standing-room-only crowds. The most talked about speaker wasn't a writer but the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos. Companies either ignored or nonexistent two years ago found themselves with all the attention they could handle. 

 ''There seems to be a 'dot' in every sentence now,'' said Stephen Corrick, a literary agent based in Chicago. ''It's been around the fringes, but this is the first time it's gotten to the middle of the discussion. It's a period of great excitement and confusion.'' 

 After a year marked by Stephen King's electronic novella ''Riding the Bullet'' and multimillion dollar investments by everyone from Microsoft to Random House, few were doubting that online bookselling and print on-demand would catch on. The question was when. Some said in a decade, or three years, or six months. 

 ''I think people will see this as one of the most significant moments in publishing history,'' Powell said. ''It's coming down the road at lightning speed.'' 

 Statistics released over the weekend confirmed how quickly the market is changing. A study reported that books sold online tripled their market share between 1998 and 1999, from 1.9 percent to 5.4 percent. More than 50 million titles were purchased by adults and no one doubts that number will increase significantly next year. 

 ''There is nothing we can imagine slowing down that trend,'' said Barrie Rappaport of NPD Group Inc., whose firm did the study. 

 So far, the ones most in danger of being damaged by Internet sales appear to be independent stores, which already have been hurt badly by superstore chains. Their market share dropped from 16.6 percent to 15.2 percent in 1999, less than half of what they controlled 10 years ago. 

 The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members. Avin Mark Domnitz said that BookSense.com, a home page providing links to independent stores, should be ready by the end of the summer. 

 ''You're going to see real changes,'' he said. 

 Meanwhile, the industry also talked books, the paper kind. Many a bookseller (and journalist) visited the booth of Scholastic, Inc., seeking in vain an early copy of the next Harry Potter story. The fourth in author J.K. Rowling's series, title and content both still a mystery, is due July 8. 

 Anticipated titles for the fall include Margaret Atwood's novel ''The Blind Assassin''; ''The Island of Lost Maps,'' a nonfiction work by Miles Harvey about cartographic crime, and new books from Jane Hamilton, Caleb Carr and David Baldacci. 

 ''We don't know which medium will be carrying the message, but I still think paper will be carrying the vast bulk for a long time,'' said Wendy J. Strothman, an executive vice president at Houghton Mifflin. 

 ''The Internet is very exciting, but you miss that opportunity for customers to browse, that serendipity of finding a book on the front table of an independent bookstore.''
