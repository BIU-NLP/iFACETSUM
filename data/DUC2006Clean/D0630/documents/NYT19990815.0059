After struggling through a drought in the mid-1990s, when readers bought fewer copies of consumer books, the publishing industry posted gains of more than 4 percent last year and is poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of online booksellers. 

 In its annual snapshot of the word trade, the Book Industry Study Group issued cautious sales projections for the glamour side of trade publishing, which produces novels and nonfiction, and a more radiant view of the future for college textbooks and business titles. 

 The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more than 2 percent annually through the year 2003 _ an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books. 

 ``We don't see the total market expanding in any dramatic shape for five years,'' said Albert Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham University who helped prepare the projections. ``If you say 10 years, it might be even more modest. I think people are reading less, and I just don't see that we're going to turn the corner and become a nation of readers.'' 

 In 1998, the sales of adult hard-cover and trade paperback books _ the top moneymakers for trade publishers _ rose by more than 4 percent from a year earlier, to 497 million copies. It was the second year of growth in unit sales after a two-period ending in 1996 when consumers cut back on their purchases. 

 Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent. 

 The study does not include figures for 1999, but several top publishers say they are experiencing a surge in sales that encompasses not only popular fare like ``Hannibal'' by Thomas Harris or the ``Harry Potter'' children's series by J.K. Rowling but also histories like John Keegan's ``The First World War.'' 

 ``We've seen a strong market since last summer _ all publishing divisions, all formats, all categories,'' said Peter Olson, the chief executive of Random House, the Bertelsmann AG unit that is the largest trade publisher in the United States. Olson gave credit for some of the strength to online retailers that now account for roughly 4 to 5 percent of the company's sales. 

 Olson said that the company's worldwide sales of $1.6 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June had exceeded expectations. The North American side of the company _ in the United States and Canada _ accounted for about 80 percent of all sales. 

 ``I think that the attention that Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com have generated has increased interest in books in general, and that has led to buying not just online, but in stores,'' Olson said. 

 Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year. But the trade organization speculates that the discrepancy may be because that study did not include acquisitions made by libraries. 

 Though the industry study does not predict an expansion of the market because of online sales, its current sales figures indicate that electronic publishing and bookselling are reshaping the market in other ways. 

 For example, the unit sales of books about science and technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in 1995, falling 8 percent to 74 million copies last year. And those drops are expected to continue, the result of a shift to electronic publishing _ that is, distribution of books by disk, CD-ROM or over the Internet _ by technical publishers like Bertelsmann's Springer Verlag unit in New York. 

 In the last few weeks, Springer has transformed ``Prokaryotes,'' a four-volume $2,000 set of books about bacteria, into an electronic version that will sell for less than half that price. Ruediger Gebauer, Springer's chief executive, said that no one was sure yet whether electronic publishing would expand the market. But he expected that the electronic versions would make such books accessible to many more people. 

 ``The libraries, in theory, keep information to everybody,'' he said. ``But in reality it's only the people who go to the library. Online publishing opens it up to virtually everybody.'' 

 The Book Industry Study Group report also suggests that the Internet and online book sales may figure in the continuing fall-off in mail-order purchases, which has dropped 26 percent from a high of 105 million copies in 1993. 

 But the Internet does not affect all categories. Religious books, for instance, are not sold in high volumes by electronic booksellers, but sales in that category continue to improve, increasing almost 16 percent, to 170 million copies since 1993. And those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving fundamentalist Christian publishers. 

 ``You've got an aging population, and I think as people go on in life they turn to more spiritual matters,'' said Eric Major, director of the Doubleday religious division for Random House. ``Oddly enough, we've seen a surge in books about the lives of saints or books about people's religious experiences. The great thing about this area of religion publishing is that it now includes business books, parenting books, dieting books and relationships books.'' 

 The sales of textbooks for college and elementary students also continue to grow. At the university level sales grew more than 19 percent, to 176 million copies, between 1993 and 1998. 

 But those trends have not necessarily raised sales by the 80 or so university presses in the United States. The sales of university books grew by almost 4 percent to 18.5 million copies from a year earlier. And the report projects only modest increases for the next five years. 

 ``That's an indication of a mature market,'' said Peter Givler, executive director of the Association of American University Presses, a trade organization. ``I think that it is very much a market in turmoil. The sales for university presses have been flat for a couple of years, and the presses are looking for new sources of revenues.'' 

 Some university presses are starting to experiment by publishing electronic journals, he said, but to date it is unclear to the members whether online bookselling and electronic publishing will be a boon. 

 ``Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth,'' Givler said, ``but nobody knows how that is going to play out. It seems that everybody thinks this is a logical way to purchase books and there ought to be some way to work it out, but we haven't found a way to do it.''
