SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of California booksellers is urging the state to be more forceful in collecting taxes from on-line bookstores. 

 At a gathering in San Francisco, the group of independent shopkeepers took specific aim at three giants of e-commerce: Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com. 

 ``We demand the state's Board of Equalization collects sales tax as existing law requires,'' said Hut Landon, owner of Landon Books in Corte Madera. ``This is an instance where the state is handing major retailers a huge advantage.'' 

 The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association. 

 ``It's clearly discriminatory,'' said Neal Sofman, who hosted the event at his own store, A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books on Van Ness Avenue. ``If this imbalance remains, we'll lose our tax base.'' 

 When asked about the request of the bookstore owners, Board of Equalization Chairman Johan Klehs said the state is, indeed, enforcing the existing tax code. 

 ``In California, the rules for e-commerce are the same as catalog selling,'' Klehs said. ``If you have a nexus in California, or employees in California, you're required to collect sales tax.'' 

 The U.S. Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce is considering whether to tax transactions that take place on the Internet. The 1998 law creating the study commission placed a three-year moratorium on new taxes targeting Internet services or Internet access services. 

 The law does not exempt e-commerce companies from having to pay state sales taxes. 

 Andy Ross, who owns Cody's Books in Berkeley, said he first complained to the state in July and has received little satisfaction from the Board of Equalization so far. 

 ``Tax policy should not be politicized,'' said Ross, who went on to accuse the Board of Equalization of bowing to Silicon Valley pressure. ``Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com are not collecting taxes in clear violation of the law. It's bad policy and bad politics.'' 

 The state and national booksellers associations maintain that the three on-line booksellers have a formidable presence in California and that should count as an established nexus. 

 ``The idea that these are not California businesses is just nonsense,'' said Bill Petrocelli, owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera. ``Large Internet commerce people are being given a free ride. That's simply wrong.'' 

 Rich Prem, a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche in San Francisco, sides with the on-line retailers, saying they are doing nothing wrong.

 ``The way the current tax laws work, the position that Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Borders are taking is legal,'' Prem said. ``The fact that they're not collecting sales tax is perfectly legal. The companies have set up subsidiaries for on-line retailing.''

 Prem said a little-known or enforced tax, called the ``use tax,'' could be the answer to the Internet taxation riddle. 

 ``It's a tax that's imposed on a purchaser that buys something from out of state and brings it into the state to use it,'' Prem said. ``It's been on the books in California since the 1930s, but is seldom enforced.''
