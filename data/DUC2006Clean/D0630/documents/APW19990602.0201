NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes & Noble, the world's largest bookstore chain, called off its $600 million purchase of the world's biggest book distributor Wednesday because of opposition from antitrust regulators.

 Barnes & Noble and Ingram Book Group said they worried that their businesses would suffer during a prolonged review by the Federal Trade Commission.

 Some FTC staff members had concluded that the merger could give Barnes & Noble an unfair competitive position.

 ``The review process has been disappointing to us,'' Ingram chairman John R. Ingram said. ``The events of the last several days have made it clear that some staff hold an outdated view of the marketplace, making an objective analysis of the transaction impossible.'' 

 The deal has been under fire since it was announced in November. 

 Critics said it could allow Barnes & Noble to delay delivery of best sellers to independent stores and big rivals such as Borders, or gain access to its competitors' buying practices.

 Barnes & Noble, however, had said the acquisition would have allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes & Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost.

 The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger. 

 ``This shows that David can beat Goliath sometimes,'' said Oren Teicher, chief operating officer of the booksellers group. 

 ``When this proposed deal was first announced, virtually nobody predicted that this deal could be stopped. Small booksellers wrote letters, made phone calls, did everything to raise awareness of this issue, and against extraordinary odds, they have succeeded.'' 

 FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky did not deny that the commission was considering blocking the deal. He cited concerns about whether small bookstores and Internet merchants would be injured if the merger were permitted. 

 Barnes & Noble isn't the only company looking to expand its distribution network. Many booksellers, including Amazon.com, are building and acquiring centers around the country to make it easier and faster to get any book to any customer.

 Ingram, a subsidiary of privately held Ingram Industries Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., distributes trade books, audio tapes, textbooks and specialty magazines through 11 distribution centers around the nation. It ships 115 million titles every year. 

 Barnes & Noble said it will use the $600 million it had earmarked for the merger for other investments and acquisitions. It will also go forward with plans to build two new distribution centers of its own, one in Reno, Nev., the other in Memphis, Tenn.
