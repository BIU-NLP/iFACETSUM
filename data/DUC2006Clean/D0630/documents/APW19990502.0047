LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I'm a writer now,'' Bill Murray announced to a crowd of publishers and booksellers, ``and in order to give you a feeling for the book that I've written I have come completely unprepared.'' 

 Murray, co-author of the golf book and memoir ``A Cinderella Story,'' was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America, the industry's annual convention. 

 ``I became a writer,'' he continued, ``back in 1999. I had approximately, uh, the rest of the month to finish it. And those of you who know the month of February know what I'm talking about.'' 

 He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to all the independent booksellers in his own special way. 

 ``I've never gone to the Internet and sat down and read anything,'' he said. ``But I've never gone to the Internet and shoplifted, either.''
