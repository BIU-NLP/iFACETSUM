 SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE FIGHT TO WEB &QL; 

 Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites. On June 6, the American Booksellers Association will introduce Booksense.com, a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores. Next to come, in early July, is Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial content. ``Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice,'' said Roxanne Coady of R.J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who is participating in both sites.
