PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation. 

 The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 

 ``Europa is really just on the edge of the area we consider hazardous from the radiation point of view,'' he said. ``We really thought this one would go pretty well, and it has so far.'' 

 The spacecraft's computer and instruments appeared to be operating normally. Data collected during the pass was stored aboard the probe's computer to be relayed back to Earth over the next several weeks. 

 Galileo measured Europa's magnetic fields in an effort to detect disturbances from a suspected liquid ocean beneath the moon's icy crust. Some scientists believe life could survive in a liquid ocean beneath the frozen surface. 

 During a flyby of the moon Io in November, Galileo's computer entered a safe-mode just before its closest encounter. A similar problem occurred during an October flyby of Io. 

 Engineers now believe they know what caused the problem -- a radiation-damaged memory chip. 

 ``We've got some programs on the ground ready to go that would help us define the problem faster than we did the previous time,'' Erickson said. 

 Meanwhile, the space agency has agreed in principle to continue Galileo's operations past Jan. 31, when its current mission was to end. Funding and other details have not yet been worked out, he said. 

 Another Io flyby is planned for Feb. 22, with encounters with Ganymede on May 30 and Dec. 28. Joint observations with the Cassini spacecraft could take place in December, when the Saturn-bound probe swoops past the giant planet.
