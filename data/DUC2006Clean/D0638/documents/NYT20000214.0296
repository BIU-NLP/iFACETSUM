The weather on Jupiter seems always stormy. Lightning flashes deep in the enveloping gas clouds. Eddies of atmospheric turbulence bob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic, long-lived whirlpools. 

 Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds, and new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy updrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather. 

 Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is similar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat from a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not from sunlight. 

 Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current issue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how Jupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather system, although many questions remain unanswered. 

 A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell University found the most telling evidence in images, from visible and infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the southern hemisphere. 

 Lightning was visible there before dawn. A few hours later, a cluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there. The scientists estimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms corresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat source. 

 ``We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant factor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian atmosphere,'' Gierasch's group wrote. 

 In another report, a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning preceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of large amounts of water in the deep clouds. Nothing else, they noted, could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the upper layer of the atmosphere. 

 ``So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place where there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air columns _ a source of energy for the eddies,'' Ingersoll explained. ``The eddies, in turn, get pulled apart by shear flow and give up their energy to these large-scale features. So ultimately, the Great Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these eddies.'' 

 On Earth, violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled by the warm ocean. The water is heated by sunlight, which drives all terrestrial weather. But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the Sun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as on Earth, not enough to generate the observed tempests. 

 Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter's internal heat somehow churns the thick atmosphere. Because of the heat reservoir of highly compressed hydrogen at its core, the planet generates nearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun. But how did that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather? 

 Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism, said Dr. Alvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., but there was no firm evidence until now. 

 In an accompanying journal article, Seiff said the new research represented ``a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter's weather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and transports significant amounts of energy.'' 

 But he said, ``Much work remains for us to gain a broad description of Jupiter's fluid behavior.'' One remaining uncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer layers of the planet's thick clouds.
