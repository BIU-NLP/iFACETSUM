WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Initial analysis of early data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA press conference Monday. 

 The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and sent back data on its way to demise. 

 "The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our most optimistic predictions," said Dr. Wesler Huntress, Associate Administrator for Space Science with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 

 "It will allow the scientific community to develop valuable new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system and the origins of life within it," he added. 

 The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere offered some surprise. It contains lower than expected levels of helium, neon, and some heavy elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur, said projects scientists. 

 The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere. It provides evidence that the energy source driving Jupiter's circulation is "probably heat escaping from the deep interior of the planet," said Dr. Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center. 

 "The probe also discovered an intense new radiation belt above Jupiter's cloud tops, and a veritable absence of lighting." 

 The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere. 

 Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were formed. 

 The Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7 last year. It sent back more than 30 minutes of data before its life came to an end under extreme conditions including entry speed of about 170,000 kilometers per hour, temperatures twice those on the surface of the Sun and 230 times the strength of gravity on the Earth. 

 Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
