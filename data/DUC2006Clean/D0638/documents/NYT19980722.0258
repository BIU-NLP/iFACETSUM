WASHINGTON _ From the accumulation of bits and pieces of fact, scientists are beginning to think that a small planet-like body just millions of miles from Earth may harbor conditions that could support life. 

 On Europa, a moon that races through dim sunlight in an orbit that takes it around Jupiter every three and a half days, there appears to be enough heat and water to support forms of life already found in some of the Earth's more inhospitable places. 

 No one yet knows whether Europa has the third ingredient: the organic material necessary for life as it is understood on Earth. 

 But the question is becoming more than a matter of scientific speculation. 

 Within five years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) hopes to launch a spacecraft to orbit the Jovian moon, chiefly to find out if any part of the huge ocean that surrounds it is liquid or whether Europa is a just hunk of rock and metal, covered by a thick shell of ice. 

 The spacecraft might carry a small landing vehicle, said Carl Pilcher, NASA scientific director for Solar System exploration. 

 The central reason for the agency's interest in Europa, he said, is the feeling that this, above all other extraterrestrial places in the solar system, could be the home of some kind of living organism. 

 He emphasized that there are no plans ``for decades to come'' to attempt to retrieve material from Europa's icy surface and return it to Earth. 

 A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life. 

 ``Importantly, the task group found that there is significant potential for a living entity to be present in samples returned from Europa or Ganymede,'' another moon of Jupiter, the committee stated. 

 It added that the biological potential on Europa _ which it called ``one of the most interesting objects in the solar system'' _ appears to be greater than on Ganymede. 

 In the last few months, scientists at NASA have been intrigued by new evidence suggesting that a vast body of salty, liquid water lies beneath Europa's frozen crust, a sort of ``buried'' ocean that may be as much as 60 miles deep. 

 The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons. 

 Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa. 

 Based on studies of its gravitational field, scientists are pretty much convinced that Europa is composed of a metallic center, possibly iron, which is surrounded by a shell of rock. The rock shell is surround in turn by a layer of water. 

 The question they need answered is whether the water is all frozen or consists of a liquid ocean on which floats a layer of ice that may be several miles thick. 

 From Europa's surface, Jupiter would appear as a huge, dark body in a mostly black sky, said Gerald Schubert a planetary physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an interdisciplinary scientist on the Galileo mission. 

 Slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, Europa is wrenched by the tidal forces of Jupiter's overpowering gravity, Schubert said. 

 ``As it orbits Jupiter, it contracts, expands, twists and contorts,'' Schubert said. 

 ``There should be a hell of a lot of heat in the interior as a result of this tidal effect,'' he said in an interview. ``There could be a tremendous amount of volcanic activity because of this internal heat. Whether there actually is or not, we don't know.'' 

 That kind of heat could explain why the surface of Europa is covered by fractures and ridges. The criss-crossed lines look much like the broken ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and coastal areas of Antarctica. 

 The cracks also could be caused by Europa's flexing tides. However, some of the cracks show signs that something from underneath has oozed out and has been deposited on the surface, Schubert said. 

 In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons. This has produced still more intriguing information about Europa. 

 The magnetic field of Jupiter varies as Europa orbits through it, he explained. The effect is not unlike conditions inside an electric motor. 

 When a material that can conduct electricity passes through a varying magnetic field, an electric current is generated in the moving material. That current then generates its own magnetic field. 

 Surrounding Europa are magnetic patterns that are typical of fields generated by electric currents, Schubert said. 

 The currents could be generated as Europa moves though Jupiter's magnetic field. But the key question is what could be conducting those currents. The metallic core of the body is too far from Galileo to produce magnetic fields the satellite could detect, Schubert said. 

 And the rocky shell would not conduct electricity well enough to carry the current. 

 ``It appears these magnetic fields could only be explained by electric currents in a salty liquid ocean near the surface,'' Schubert said. 

 Pilcher said the space mission planned for 2003 would carry a laser altimeter, capable of very precise measurements of the satellite's distance from the surface of Europa. 

 If the Jupiter moon is covered with solid ice, then tidal variations on the surface might be no more than a few meters, but if there is a large body liquid water sloshing around beneath that ice, then the tides would be much greater. 

 The orbiter also would carry infrared imaging equipment to examine surface features and a sounding radar capable of examining the subsurface several kilometers deep, he said. 

 Although there are no specific plans for a lander, such a device might be added as a technology-testing prototype. 

 If that is done, instruments to test the surface for the presence of organic chemicals might be added, he said. 

 But sending a lander to the surface of Europa and retrieving a sample of the ice or perhaps of the ancient ooze laying along the sides of the moon's criss-crossed fractures is something that hasn't even been seriously considered, Pilcher said. 

 One reason: the same gravitational stresses that knead Europa like a big ice-covered doughball would create almost unthinkable obstacles to launching the vehicle when it has finished collecting its samples.
