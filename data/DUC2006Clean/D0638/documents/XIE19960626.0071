WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Spacecraft Galileo will close in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede early Thursday morning to gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy satellite, according to a NASA report. 

 Equipped with 10 scientific instruments, Galileo, the 2.5-ton unmanned probe launched in October 1989, will fly only 840 kilometers above Ganymede's surface at 2:29 a.m. Eastern Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), or 0629 GMT Thursday. 

 Galileo will return high-resolution images showing features on Ganymede as small as 10 meters across. It will also assess the moon's surface chemistry and search for signs of an atmosphere. 

 If Galileo's operations and the subsequent transmission of data to Earth occur as planned, NASA said, selected images of Ganymede will be released in a televised news conference on July 10. 

 Galileo's Ganymede encounter marks the start of a steady stream of data to be returned to Earth throughout its two-year tour of the Jovian system. The data return will include an average of two to three images per day before December 1997, NASA said. 

 Galileo's other studies will include a search for auroral activity on Jupiter's nightside and observations of other Jovian moons, such as Io, Europa and Callisto. 

 With a diameter of 5,230 kilometers, Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system -- bigger than Mercury and about three-fourths the size of Mars. It has a variety of Earth-like geological formations and is believed to be about half water-ice and half rock.
