SAN FRANCISCO _ In close-up photos, the many moons of Jupiter appear eerie and alien. But scientists believe that three moons probably have something in common with Earth: ice-covered oceans. 

 Also, a giant fault like the San Andreas Fault in California has been discovered on one of the icy moons, Europa. The 500-mile fault has a large, 30-mile-plus displacement similar to that along the San Andreas. 

 ``Comparisons between this ... fault (on Europa) and faults on Earth may generate ideas we can use in studying earth movements here on our planet,'' University of Arizona space scientist Randy Tufts said Monday at the American Geophysical Union conference here. He displayed the photos taken by the Galileo space probe. 

 Galileo's measurements of the magnetic field of one Jovian moon, Ganymede, indicate it contains electrical conducting layers characteristic of an ocean, said Margaret G. Kivelson, a space scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles. 

 Confirmation of oceans on such Jovian moons must await visits by robotic space probes, scientists said at an all-day seminar on the latest information from Galileo, which is now orbiting Jupiter. 

 Until then, ``when I'm saying `oceans,' I'm not specifically getting out my surfboard,'' Kivelson said with a laugh. 

 In coming years, scientists and engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hope to launch a robotic probe to the Jovian moon Europa. The lander would settle on the icy surface, then melt its way through to the hidden ocean. That ocean might contain life forms warmed by undersea volcanoes. 

 The Jovian moon Callisto also probably contains an ocean, based on theoretical studies of its known composition, said space scientist David J. Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology. He estimates the ocean is roughly 60 miles deep and lies under about 90 miles of ice. 

 Like its moons, Jupiter _ the biggest planet in the solar system _ has earthlike aspects. Lightning and auroras are among them, the researchers said. 

 Jupiter even has super-lightning. The most energetic bolts are 1,000 times as powerful as the average terrestrial bolt, Caltech space scientist Andrew P. Ingersoll said. And Jupiter's hurricanes are mammoth _ as big as Earth itself. 

 Despite these slight similarities to Earth, Jupiter and its moons are far stranger than anything seen on this planet. Jupiter has faint rings, for example. Joseph Burns, a space scientist at Cornell University, said the Jovian rings are formed from dusty debris knocked off moons by meteoroids. 

 And Jupiter's little moon Io _ where ferocious volcanoes spew lava night and day _ may have a weirdly shaped magnetic field, said Gary A. Glatzmaier, a space scientist at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Because of Io's hot, bubbling interior and its gravitational and electromagnetic interactions with Jupiter, the moon may have four magnetic poles, Glatzmaier said. Earth has just two magnetic poles. 

 Hence a traveler carrying a compass around Io would tend to get lost.
