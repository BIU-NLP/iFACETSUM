WASHINGTON (AP) _ Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself, researchers say. Using instruments orbiting Jupiter on the Galileo spacecraft, researchers calculated the temperature of lava spewing from volcanoes on Io. They found that 12 vents had temperatures of 2,200 degrees F (just over 1,200 C) and that one vent was as hot as 3,100 degrees (more than 1,700 C). The temperature of lava erupting to the surface on Earth is generally around 2,000 F, or almost 1,100 C, according to standard references. ``The very hot lavas erupting on Io are hotter than anything that has erupted on Earth for billions of years,'' said Alfred McEwen, lead author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. ``They are the highest surface temperatures in the solar system other than the sun itself.'' Io is so far from the sun, about 1.2 billion miles, that most of its surface is well below freezing. Only in or near the volcano vents is the moon's surface warm.
