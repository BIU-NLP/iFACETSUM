The vast warm ocean that probably lies beneath the iceberg-studded crust of Europa is equally salty too, scientists now say. 

 A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the mysterious satellites. 

 ``Until now, we thought Callisto was a dead and boring moon, just a hunk of rock and ice,'' said space physicist Margaret Kivelson of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has been using Galileo's magnetometer to measure electric currents flowing from Jupiter for nearly three years. 

 ``The new data certainly suggest that something is hidden below Callisto's surface, and that something may well be a salty ocean,''she said. 

 As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the presence of organic matter _ the possible precursors of life _ in a warm ocean miles beneath the ice. 

 The two moons possess only weak magnetic fields of their own. But the electric currents that Galileo's magnetometer first detected on Europa's surface indicate that Jupiter's erratic magnetic field is strongly influencing the currents around the satellite, Kivelson said. That fact, she and her colleagues theorize, would best be explained by a liquid ocean salty enough to conduct electromagnetic currents. 

 Although the team had no evidence that Callisto was anything but an inert rocky satellite whose craters are pocked with ice, the scientists reviewed their magnetometer data from Galileo when the spacecraft flew past the moon three times in 1996 and last year. 

 To their surprise, Kivelson said Wednesday, they found evidence of electric currents flowing on Callisto's surface, and they too could only be explained if beneath the rock and ice there existed a salty ocean carrying electrical currents sufficient to produce a full-scale magnetic field. 

 Although life is conceivably possible in Europa's relatively warm ocean, it is most unlikely in the waters of Callisto because not enough energy would be available there, said Galileo project scientist Torrance Johnson at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Wednesday. 

 On Europa the ocean's warmth is produced both by internal radioactivity and by tidal energy generated by the moon's closeness to Jupiter, Johnson said. But Callisto has no tidal energy because it is much farther from Jupiter, so its only heat would come from internal radioactivity _ not nearly enough for life to exist, Johnson said. 

 The team studying magnetic forces on the two moons includes scientists from UCLA, Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where the Galileo mission is controlled. A full report on the group's new findings is being published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature.
