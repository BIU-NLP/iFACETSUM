New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava glowing in red pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io. Electricity sets gases aglow, and, in black space around the moon, there is an arc of light generated by power surges of more than 400,000 volts. Tidal forces from Jupiter twist and contort little Io, creating frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes, said Paul Geissler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There is enough lava flowing every year on Io, said Geissler, to cover the entire surface almost a half inch (1 centimeter) deep. For this reason, the little moon is the only major body known in the solar system to have no evidence of asteroid craters. The lava erases impact marks, he said. Pillon, a major Io volcano, spews lava that is about 2,600 F (1,426 C), hundreds of degrees hotter than volcanoes now active on Earth, said Geissler. As it orbits Jupiter, Io intersects powerful magnetic field lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical generator. The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter and pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo. Near the surface, the combination of electricity and gases from the volcanoes creates an even more unusual sight, said Geissler. Sulfur dioxide venting from the volcanoes is energized by the charged particles from the electrical fields. The gas then glows in a brilliant blue. Io also has fields of red and green, generated when charged particles energize molecules of oxygen and hydrogen and other gases. ``This light show has been going on for a billion years,'' said Geissler, ``and this is the first time it has ever been seen.'' Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at least another year. Io is 2,236 miles (3,598 kilometers) in diameter, slightly larger than the Earth's moon. Io is one of four Jovian moons discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, one of the first astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope. Jupiter's other major moons are Ganymede, Europa and Callisto. Jupiter has at least a dozen smaller moons. ___ &QC; Use the information from the story to answer the following true and false questions: _____ 1. Photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft show that Jupiter's moon Io is aglow with colorful light. _____ 2. More than 30 volcanoes have been discovered on the small moon. _____ 3. Lava from Pillon, one of Io's volcanoes, is 2,600 F (1,426 C) hotter than lava found on Earth. _____ 4. No asteroid craters (holes) can be seen on the little sphere because flowing lava continues to cover its surface. _____ 5. Electricity is produced when Io crosses the magnetic field lines of its mother planet, Jupiter. _____ 6. It takes the small moon exactly 2 1/2 years to orbit Jupiter. _____ 7. When sulfur dioxide is energized, it appears bright blue. _____ 8. Scientists are hoping to find ways for U.S. power plants to make use of Io's 400,000 volts of electricity. _____ 9. The brilliant light show was first seen hundreds of years ago by the astronomer Galileo Galilei. _____ 10. Io has been glowing for a billion years. _____ BONUS: It is likely that soon you will be able to travel to Jupiter in order to get a closer look at its glimmering moon. ___ &QC; MOON MATCH-UP: Jupiter and Earth aren't the only planets that have satellites. Listed below are the names of five moons that orbit the planets Mars, Neptune, Pluto, Saturn and Uranus. Use an encyclopedia to help you match each moon with its mother planet.
