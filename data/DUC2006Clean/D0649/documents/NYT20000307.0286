MOSCOW _ With a hefty lead in the polls, Vladimir Putin has perfected his campaign strategy _ act presidential, shun televised debates and mock some of the other rituals of electoral politics. 

 The tactics of the acting, and almost certainly future, president were on display Tuesday on a visit to Ivanovo, a down-at-the-heels textile factory town 180 miles northeast of Moscow. 

 Addressing a sympathetic audience, Putin boasted that he would neither participate in televised debates nor debase himself by preparing campaign commercials. 

 The next president, he insisted, should be involved in the work of building a strong state, not an official caught up in the world of image makers, focus groups, pollsters and political advertising. 

 ``These videos, their advertising,'' Putin said. ``I will not be trying to find out in the course of my election campaign which is more important, Tampax or Snickers.'' 

 Putin's calculated indifference to the process appears to be paying off. Putin does not need campaign commercials, and he can afford to forego the free television time to which he and other candidates are entitled on state television. Every move he makes is extensively reported and broadcast nationwide on the state-owned channels. In effect, his weeks as acting president are an unofficial campaign commercial. 

 Opinion polls put his approval rating at more than 50 percent of the vote, 10 percent to 30 percent ahead of his nearest challenger, Gennadi Zyuganov, the communist candidate. 

 The larger question is whether Putin's actions are simply those of a cautious politician who is trying to protect his lead or a quasi-authoritarian leader disdainful of the democratic process of appealing for votes. At this stage, the answer is unclear, in view of the fact that Putin has never run for office, and is a former intelligence official elevated to national office by appointment. 

 Andrei Piontkovsky, a leading leading Russian political analyst and no friend of Putin, said both factors were at work. 

 ``He despises open politics and prefers intrigues in the corridors of power,'' Piontkovsky said. ``He is afraid to debate. So his team is creating the image that he is the father of the nation who is too busy protecting us from terrorism to debate his opponents.'' 

 Even with his austere approach, Putin has found many opportunities to project a softer side, all the more important for a man whose career was forged in the KGB and who is best known for presiding over the increasingly bloody war in Chechnya. Putin has talked in a Russian television interview about his buying his daughters a small white poodle _ a difficult, emotional decision, he said, after his first dog had died. The new poodle made a cameo appearance in the interview. 

 And he has allowed himself to be filmed skiing in Sochi and displaying his common touch at the blini counter there. 

 Tuesday, Putin began his day in Moscow handing out awards in honor of International Women's Day, a Russian holiday that has acquired the status of Mother's Day, St. Valentine's Day and Secretary's Day all rolled into one. Putin declared that the most sacred qualities of Russian life were always connected with the image of a woman. Lidiya Smirnova, 85, an actress who received an award, decided to return the favor, proclaiming that Putin's style of walking demonstrated that he was a man of strong character. 

 Then, Putin headed to Ivanovo. Officially, his aides maintained that the visit was not a campaign trip, that the acting president merely wanted to be at an important conference about the economically depressed town, they said. Putin told the workers that high taxes had contributed to industrial decline and that the government needed to stimulate business. ``The higher the degree of economic freedom of economic entities,'' he said, ``the higher the level of development of the state.'' 

 Putin also engaged in some damage control. He created a stir Sunday by telling the BBC on the eve of a visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he could not exclude the possibility that Russia might one day join NATO. 

 The remark was intended more as a gesture of Putin's intention to establish friendly ties with the West than a concrete proposal, especially because the alliance has never considered inviting Russia to join, and some NATO countries are dead set against that. 

 Although the comments were warmly received in Western capitals, they raised potential political problems at home, as many Russians view NATO as the enemy. Zyuganov denounced the comments as ``naive and unforgivable.'' 

 Tuesday, Putin did some backtracking, saying: ''Nobody is going to admit Russia into NATO.We have never thought this could happen.''
