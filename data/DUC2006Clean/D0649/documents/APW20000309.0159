IVANOVO, Russia (AP) -- For a candidate who insists he's too busy being president to campaign, Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of time on the road, running one of the slickest election campaigns Russians have ever seen. 

 Crisscrossing the vast country on trips described as official business, the acting president has reached out to interest groups, building support for the March 26 presidential election -- and giving himself an apparently unbeatable lead. 

 ''People in the executive must prove their worth by their concrete deeds, not advertising,'' Putin told reporters, insisting that he was not campaigning on a visit this week to Ivanovo. 

 It seems to be working with Russia's disillusioned voters, who are tired of empty promises after a decade of democracy following the Soviet collapse. Putin's image as a tough leader who can get things done goes down well with voters, even though he rarely offers specific policies. 

 ''He's a master of his word, who doesn't give empty promises,'' said Lyuba Belova, 34, a worker at the New Ivanovo weaving plant, which Putin visited. ''So what if he's a former KGB man? That means he's a well-disciplined person, and discipline is what our country needs most of all.'' 

 Putin's 11 rivals seem almost invisible. The acting president has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion polls say. 

 Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin's activities as president and his trips to the provinces, there are few signs that Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election. Putin has not accepted Zyuganov's challenge to debate him and issues have barely surfaced. 

 Unlike the 1996 election, when Boris Yeltsin defeated Zyuganov by dwelling on fears of a Communist comeback, few people take the Communists seriously anymore. Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and named Putin acting president, giving him a big edge at winning a full four-year term. 

 ''Only elderly people nostalgic of the old times will vote for Zyuganov,'' said Yelena Rusova, another worker at the weaving plant. 

 The candidates' platforms are vague, with Putin and his rivals all pledging to ensure economic growth,improve miserable living standards, combat corruption and crime, and restore Russia as a great power. 

 Zyuganov talks about rolling back market reforms and reviving Soviet-era economic controls. Putin says he will go on with market reform, while boosting state economic oversight to ensure everyone gets a fair break. 

 ''The choice isn't between Putin and Zyuganov. It's a question of to be or not to be for Russia,'' the Communist chief said recently, adding that Putin's program ''is murderous for Russia.'' 

 A group of economic experts, including reformers, has been working out an economic program for Putin, but it's not clear when it will be unveiled. 

 ''I think that it would be offered to the public even before the election,'' Putin said on a recent trip, then quickly added: ''Surely, before the election.'' 

 Putin has focused on reaching out to the country's various interest groups, such as local government officials, farm workers and factory crews, showing interest in the problems each segment faces. 

 In Ivanovo, a major textile center 190 miles east of Moscow, Putin was targeting two groups at once -- industrial workers and women. So many women work in the city that it is known as ''The City of Brides.'' 

 The visit coincided with International Women's Day on Wednesday -- a national holiday when women traditionally receive gifts and flowers. Putin spoke about reviving the textile industry, then complimented his mostly female audience. 

 ''The official purpose of this trip is to attend an official meeting dedicated to prospects of light industries, but the real reason is to visit Ivanovo ... the women's capital -- on the eve of March 8,'' he said Tuesday as the hall burst into applause. ''We owe everything to women.'' 

 But Putin prefers to address big official gatherings and rarely seems comfortable chatting with people, rarely going out to press the flesh. Not that the voters seem to mind. 

 ''He has a lot of work to do, he has no time to lose,'' Belova said as Putin rushed through her workshop without stopping to talk to any of the admiring workers.
