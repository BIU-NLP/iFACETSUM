MOSCOW _ An energetic-looking President-elect Vladimir Putin arrived at work Monday to meet with government leaders, but instead of triumphant speeches about his election victory, Putin shed no light about which way he'll lead the economy and society. 

 ``The level of expectations is very high. People are tired and struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but miracles don't happen,'' he said. ``A lot of things that will lead to many controversies need to be done.'' 

 With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov finished in second place with a stronger-than-expected 29 percent, and liberal Gregory Yavlinsky was third with 6 percent. 

 Although Putin's victory has been expected since former President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on Dec. 31, the novice politician appeared unprepared with the first tough tasks of office, namely nominating a new prime minister and Cabinet. 

 Putin's chief of staff, Dmitry Kozak, said Putin would wait to publish his economic plan and list of ministerial candidates until after his inauguration, which the Central Election Commission tentatively scheduled for May 5. Putin cannot officially call himself president until that time. 

 Putin gave no hints Monday as to who he favors to head his new government, saying only that cooperation is needed from all political parties and that the results of the elections will have to figure into his decision making. 

 Analysts said this signalled Putin's willingness to make room for political opposition in the new government, especially the Communists, with whom Putin's parliamentary bloc already has a strategic alliance in the Duma, the lower house of parliament. 

 Yet even as Putin extended an olive branch to his rivals, Zyuganov spent the day vilifying the elections as a sham, full of gross violations. ``They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,'' he said. 

 Russia's election commission as well as the head of the team of international observers led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, denied the allegations, saying if minor irregularities occurred they would not change the overall results. 

 The OSCE's special representative in charge of the observer mission, Helle Degn, characterized the elections as fair ``to a certain degree,'' calling into question biased media coverage of the campaign. 

 Putin, 47, a virtual unknown in the Russian political world until becoming prime minister in August, received flattering and blanket coverage by the country's most influential broadcasters _ state-run television stations ORT and RTR _ throughout the three-month campaign, which began after former President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned on Dec. 31. Putin's opponents, meanwhile, found themselves the target of negative attacks on TV, or simply not shown at 

 all. 

 Putin's successful manipulation of the media, to forward the government's war in the rebellious republic of Chechnya and to publicize his preferred campaign image of a tough-talking, effective leader, is one of the many reasons detractors fear him. 

 ``He's full of words _ promises to end corruption, promises to build our society again _ but we don't know who he really is or who stands behind him,'' said Alexei Slavin, a Russian voter who chose ``None of the Above'' on the ballot sheet as a protest against Putin. 

 The former KGB officer's victory came as a relief to many Russians after Yeltsin's poor health and the legacy of corruption allegations within his family. 

 Still, many people from Yeltsin's Kremlin administration widely considered to have tight relations with the country's so-called ``oligarchs'' still held their jobs Monday morning. This fact causes concern among anti-Putin observers that the country was in for not a new era, like Putin promised voters, but four more years of the same situation. 

 ``I want to see him get rid of the rot (the oligarchs and their Kremlin connections). Then maybe I'll change my mind'' about him, said political analyst Lilia Schvetsova from the Moscow Carnegie Center. 

 Although the Clinton administration has expressed uncertainty over how vigorously Putin will pursue democratic change, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that his words have the right tone. 

 ``Russians evidently want to live in a more orderly society. The United States will watch closely to see how former intelligence officer Vladimir Putin will try to instill this order as president,'' she said in an interview with CNN. ``I think we're going to have to see'' how strong Putin's commitment to democracy is.'' 

 Putin, born Oct. 7, 1952, is a fluent German speaker. He is married and has two children.
