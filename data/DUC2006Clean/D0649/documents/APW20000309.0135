MOSCOW (AP) -- The economic program that acting President Vladimir Putin has said he will unveil before this month's elections will combine liberalization measures with stronger state regulation, the man heading its development said Thursday. 

 ''On the one hand, we need deregulation, but, on the other hand, the state's role must be increased,'' German Gref, the head of the Center of Strategic Research think-tank, said on Echo of Moscow radio. 

 Putin is widely considered to be a shoo-in in the March 26 balloting, despite his vague stance on how to address many of Russia's complex economic problems. He has promised to release the program before the election. 

 Putin has been recording support of about 60 percent in pre-election opinion polls, against about 20 percent for Communist Gennady Zyuganov, his nearest challenger. 

 Campaigning by all 12 candidates has been minimal. 

 Gref, who worked alongside Putin in the St. Petersburg city government, said the government must streamline control over its assets and strengthen its traditional functions, such as law enforcement. 

 At the same time, he argued, the state must stop meddling in every aspect of private business and requiring permission for every small step. ''We must end an omnipresent state control of businesses,'' he said. 

 Graf said his think-tank regularly reports to Putin and receives his guidance. 

 He wouldn't say when the program will be unveiled. Zyuganov has repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to release his program. 

 Gref said that Putin's program will be aimed at creating conditions for steady economic growth that would bring Russia back to the ranks of major industrialized nations. 

 Putin, who chaired a Cabinet session Thursday, used the occasion to promise that the government will pay expenses of several hundred World War II veterans from the former Soviet republics who are to come to Moscow in May to take part in celebrations marking the end of that war.
