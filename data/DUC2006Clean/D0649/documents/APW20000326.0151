MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin looked set for victory Monday in Russia's presidential election after a surprisingly strong showing by the Communists threatened to force him into a runoff vote. 

 While Putin would almost certainly win a second round, it would have been a humbling setback for the former KGB officer who has soared from nowhere to become the nation's most popular politician in a few months. Putin's call to strengthen the authority of the state and the security forces worried some Russians, who fear the country's democratic reforms could be rolled back. 

 With 93 percent of the vote from Sunday's election counted by Monday morning, Putin had 52.4 percent of the vote, enough to ensure victory and avoid a second round against the next highest vote winner. Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov was second with 29.6 percent. 

 The state-run RTR television network predicted an outright Putin victory with no runoff vote. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was projected to take third place with about 7 percent of the vote. 

 Zyuganov accused the government of falsifying the results, saying the Communist vote was more than 40 percent. There were no immediate reports on the fairness of the election from international monitors. 

 ''They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,'' Zyuganov said. 

 Putin looked likely to fall well short of his campaign's hopes for a huge victory and a strong mandate for his call to impose strong government at home and to revive Russia as a global power. 

 Putin's campaign may have suffered from the widespread assumption that he would win, convincing many of his supporters that there was no need to vote. But the fairly strong vote for Zyuganov was also seen as a protest by Russians unhappy about Putin's apparently inevitable victory. 

 Putin, looking relaxed, said he was confident of victory as he voted at a Moscow polling station. ''Tomorrow is Monday, a hard day, and I will have to go to work,'' he said. 

 Putin later acknowledged the Communists had done well despite their cash-strapped campaign and that his government would have to take popular discontent into account. 

 ''That means that our policy must be more balanced, take into account the existing realities and aim at increasing living standards,'' he told a news conference. 

 The tough, man-of-action image that Putin cultivates appeals to many Russians, tired of the uncertainty and mayhem of the final years of former President Boris Yeltsin. Putin has promised to end massive corruption, revive the economy after years of recession and restore the political and military influence that Moscow wielded before the Soviet collapse. 

 ''I'm tired of all this disorder,'' said Vladimir Prishchev, a pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in Russia's Pacific port city of Vladivostok, where graft is rampant and life miserable for most people. ''When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it to the end.'' 

 Some Russians, particularly liberals, fear Putin may trample Russia's fragile democracy and restore the iron control the secret police enforced during the Soviet era. 

 But some Russian reformers and Western officials and businessmen have praised Putin as a pragmatic reformer who will restore stability in Russia and improve people's lives by making reforms work. 

 With a trademark poker face, Putin comes across as stern and colorless, often cold. He is described often as resembling the archetypal ''chekist'' or secret policeman -- which appeals to many Russians who believe tough government alone can clean up the country and restore stability. 

 Putin insists he is a democrat, but he has been vague about his plans beyond stressing the need for strong government.	   Some analysts say Putin has few specific plans because of his rapid rise to power and it may be months before his intentions are clear. Nor is Putin likely to turn things around quickly after decades of authoritarianism and economic disintegration, they add. 

 Yeltsin, who stunned Russians by resigning six months early and dubbing Putin as his political heir, said Sunday he was confident that the younger leader would continue the reforms set in place after the Soviet collapse. 

 ''Everybody is waiting for change,'' said Yeltsin after casting his ballot. ''There will be some changes, but the main thing is the course of reform must stay, and it will stay. I am convinced of that.'' 

 Putin, who rose through a series of mostly obscure government posts in the 1990s and has never held elected office, was appointed prime minister by Yeltsin in August. He gained immediate popularity for his vigorous image and his tough handling of the war in Chechnya. Putin was named acting president when Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31. 

 Little is known about Putin and extensive checks by journalists and others in recent months have produced more questions and few insights. Unlike many prominent officials, Putin has not been linked to major corruption, boosting his image in the eyes of Russians who have seen political insiders amass vast fortunes while living standards for most people plummeted. 

 The election campaign was lackluster because a Putin victory seemed inevitable. The other candidates appeared resigned to not winning and there was little in the way of campaign rallies and trips. State television lavished Putin with daily coverage, boosting his chances.
