MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin dominated the campaign field Friday, promising to raise wages for state workers and improve education, while his foes registered for the presidential race they have little chance of winning. 

 Support groups for Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and several other candidates registered with the Central Election Commission on Friday. They are now eligible to start collecting the necessary 500,000 signatures by Feb. 13. 

 A group consisting of powerful regional leaders and businessmen who nominated Putin this week has said it would gather signatures well ahead of the deadline. 

 Putin owes his popularity largely to tough handling of the war in Chechnya and promises to restore Russia to its past glory after a decade of failed reforms, falling living standards and widespread official corruption. 

 Putin used the privileges of incumbency Friday, dominating nationwide television news with his promise to raise salaries for state workers by 20 percent starting April 1. Putin promised earlier this week that pensions would be increased by the same 20 percent, not 12 percent as earlier planned. 

 Putin also pledged to education workers Friday that the government will pour more resources into schools and universities after years of neglect. 

 ``The revival of Russia is impossible without a new look at the teacher,'' he said. ``We mustn't repeat mistakes of the past.'' 

 His adversaries have been disorganized since Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation Dec. 31, which made Putin acting president and moved the election to March 26 instead of June. 

 Recent polls have shown Putin attracting the support of more than 50 percent of the electorate, with nearest rival Zyuganov registering in the teens. 

 The Union of Right Forces, a centrist group that was fourth in parliamentary elections last month, met Friday to discuss its presidential candidate. Some people proposed to nominate Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization drive who is now head of the monopolist energy utility. But Chubais said the group must support Putin.
