MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin returned to Moscow early Wednesday after a three-day working visit to Belarus, Britain and Ukraine, a visit that showed Moscow's foreign policy priorities on ties with the CIS countries and the West. 

 The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which groups 12 former Soviet republics, is Russia's backyard and strengthening relations with fellow CIS member states has all along been a top priority in Russian foreign policy. It is only too natural that Belarus and Ukraine, two major CIS members, were put on the list of Putin's first foreign trip after winning the March 26 presidential elections. 

 Britain is the least critical among Western countries of Russia's military campaign in its breakaway republic of Chechnya and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, during a recent visit to Putin's native St. Petersburg, expressed London's willingness to cooperate with Moscow. 

 For a Russia that is now keen to improve and develop relations with the West, it is sensible for Putin to choose Britain as the first Western country to visit. 

 Belarus is Russia's most staunch ally inside the CIS. A treaty on a union state between Russia and Belarus went into force on January 26, marking the start of the establishment of their union. Although the two neighbors still have to work out a unified system of currency, taxation, the customs, border control, defense and nationality of their residents, Putin's visit would boost the progress of the two country's integration. 

 During his stay in Minsk, Belarus' capital, Putin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko discussed bilateral ties and the implementation of the union treaty, reaching broad agreement on cooperation in defense, military technology and economy, Russian media reported. 

 Most observers see London as the most important leg of Putin's three-nation tour. As a major Western country, Britain enjoys close relations with the United States. At a time when France and Germany distance themselves from Moscow over Chechnya, strengthening ties with London is of "special significance" to Russia. 

 Both Putin and Blair expressed satisfaction with the outcome of their talks, which touched bilateral ties, Russian economy and Chechnya. Britain said Putin's London visit represents the establishment of brand-new strategic relations between the two countries. The Russian side described Putin's trip as a "key step forward" in its effort to improve its ties with the West. 

 Ukraine is also one of Russia's strategic partners, but their ties were marred by many problems in the energy and industrial sectors. Against the background of intensified efforts by the West to draw Ukraine closer to its lot, Putin's trip became all the more important. 

 According to Russian media reports, Ukraine owes Gazprom, Russia's state-owned natural gas monopoly, 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in debt. 

 Following their talks, Putin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma told reporters that the two countries could, through joint efforts, solve the problems hindering bilateral ties. 

 Kuchma, on his part, said their strategic partnership determines that the two countries would have fruitful collaboration in political and economic fields, despite the outstanding problems. 

 Russia's new foreign policy concept has not been made public yet, but in his election platform, Putin said he would formulate foreign policy from the standpoint of national interests. 

 Putin's latest visit and the State Duma's recent ratification of the long-delayed START II nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States offered one a glimpse on Russia's foreign policy orientation. 

 They indicate that Russia's top foreign policy priorities would include improving and developing ties with and seeking economic assistance from the West, repairing and strengthening ties with other CIS countries to safeguard Russia's "vital interests" in the so-called near abroad.
