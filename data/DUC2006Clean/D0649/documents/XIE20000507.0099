MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Putin was sworn in as Russia's second president since the breakup of the Soviet Union in an official ceremony in the Kremlin Sunday. 

 Putin, who was born on October 7, 1952 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), was elected in the March 26 presidential election with a vote of about 53 percent. 

 The inauguration ceremony was broadcast live by the country's three major television channels. 

 With his right hand on the text of the Constitution, Putin vowed "to respect and protect the rights and freedoms of man and citizen, to observe and protect the Constitution of the Russian Federation, to protect the sovereignty and independence, security and integrity of the state and to serve the people faithfully." 

 Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin, who stepped down on New Year's Eve, about six months before the expiry of his term, was present at the ceremony. 

 Appearing fit and energetic, Yeltsin congratulated Putin, wished him success and asked him to "take care of Russia and protect it." 

 In his brief speech, Putin thanked the Russians for their support in the elections and promised to work hard, to be guided by the interests of the motherland and to transform Russia into a "free, prosperous, strong and civilized" country. 

 Members of both houses of parliament, judges of the Constitutional court, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the wives of Yeltsin and Putin, religious leaders and the heads of diplomatic missions attended the ceremony.
