MOSCOW (AP) -- Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin. 

 A poll released Tuesday showed 58 percent of respondents would choose Putin if the vote were held now, to 15 percent for Zyuganov, Putin's leading opponent. The nationwide poll conducted Jan. 31 by the All-Russia Opinion Research Center had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. 

 The Central Electoral Commission approved Zyuganov's candidacy in a unanimous vote Tuesday after reviewing the required 500,000 signatures of support he had submitted, commission spokesman Artyom Golev said. It also approved his property and income declarations. 

 According to the documents filed for his candidacy, Zyuganov has two apartments and earned $17,000 in 1998-99. He also reported having two bank accounts, one with $570 and the other with $80. As a member of parliament he receives a free apartment, car and other perks. 

 The income is low by Western standards but is similar to the reported incomes of other Russian politicians -- and significantly more than that earned by most ordinary Russians. 

 Zyuganov, who came in second to incumbent Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential election, predicted Tuesday that the campaign would be unfair. He said some candidates had easy access to the media while others were denied it -- an indirect reference to state-controlled television channels, which tend to give Putin blanket, favorable attention. 

 The Communist chief also warned that the election results could be falsified. He repeated his claim that the results of the December parliamentary elections had been fixed in six regions of the country. 

 ``The current authorities are not capable of running elections honestly,'' Zyuganov told reporters. 

 The commission is to consider Putin's registration on Saturday. 

 Putin, a longtime KGB agent with little governing experience, has been vague about his electoral platform but is widely liked for his law-and-order image. 

 In a television interview Tuesday, he said, ``One has to be tough and demanding. ... People are tired of weak government.'' 

 He also dismissed fears voiced often in the West that he would lead Russia toward dictatorship. 

 ``I am deeply convinced that there will be no development, no future at all in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of press,'' he said. Those freedoms ``guarantee the state won't slide into the mire of totalitarianism.'' 

 Twenty-nine people have announced their intention to run in the election. Prominent candidates include Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But the levels of support for candidates other than Putin and Zyuganov were all in the single digits, according to the Opinion Research Center poll. 

 Another poll, studying reasons for Putin's broad popularity, showed that the majority of respondents like the 47-year-old Putin for his relatively young age and good health -- in contrast to the ailing, 69-year-old Yeltsin, who stepped down Dec. 31. That poll was released by the ROMIR polling agency on Monday. 

 Putin has been vague about his electoral platform. When asked again about it Tuesday, he promised to reveal details at a later time.
