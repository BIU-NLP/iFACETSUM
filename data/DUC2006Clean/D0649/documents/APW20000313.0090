MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin, a steely enigma to most Russians, lets his guard down a little in a book of interviews released Monday, less than two weeks before the presidential elections. 

 The book also includes interviews with his wife, two daughters and friends, offering a personal side to a man who is all-business in public. It even shows him in a candid photo moment, grimacing as he gets a smooch from his poodle. 

 Putin, a 16-year veteran of the KGB and later head of its main successor, the FSB, appears carefully controlled in public, but says in the book that there were some impulsive currents in his early life. 

 Asked why he didn't join the Pioneers, the Communist youth group in which virtually all Soviet children were members, until the sixth grade, he says: ''I was a hooligan, not a Pioneer.'' 

 And he reveals that in college he had some serious love affairs, including one that was leading to marriage -- until he got cold feet after rings and wedding finery had been bought. 

 ''I looked like the last scoundrel, but I decided it would be better to do that now than for her and me to suffer later,'' he says in the book, entitled ''From the First Person -- Conversations with Vladimir Putin.'' 

 The publisher, Vagrius, had planned to put 500,000 copies up for sale, but pulled back after being told by election officials that selling the book would violate Russia's election law and even lead to Putin's dismissal from the race. 

 Vagrius head Gleb Uspensky said Monday that the publishing house decided to print just 50,000 copies and sell all them to Putin's campaign headquarters. 

 The book discloses nothing that is likely to undermine Putin's huge lead in opinion polls ahead of the March 26 vote. He has consistently recorded support of around 60 percent, compared with about 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Communist Gennady Zyuganov. 

 It also does much to reinforce the image of firmness that apparently is Putin's strong suit with voters, especially his tough stance on Chechnya. 

 In the book, he maintains the offensive against Chechnya was necessary to save Russia -- and, possibly, the world. 

 ''I was confident that if we didn't stop the extremists, we would face the threat of Russian turning into another Yugoslavia,'' Putin says. ''Disintegration of such a vast country would trigger a global catastrophe.'' 

 Putin's rise from little-known bureaucrat to acting president coincided with the Chechnya war. He was appointed prime minister by President Boris Yeltsin in August, shortly Chechen rebels attacked the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan. 

 Putin, who took over the presidency when Yeltsin abruptly resigned Dec. 31, denied that he was riding the war into the elections. 

 While maintaining a tough tone on Chechnya, Putin reiterated in the book his recent statement that Russia may consider joining NATO, albeit adding that the country's admission would be unlikely. 

 ''I think they would fear the destruction of NATO,'' he said. ''We are too powerful a force.'' 

 Putin, asked to name historical figures he admires, first said Napoleon Bonaparte. Then he added former French President Charles de Gaulle and German Chancellor Ludvig Erhard. 

 The new personal revelations aside, many of Putin's positions remain unclear, including detailed proposals on how to address Russia's economic problems. 

 On Monday, he promised to strengthen protection of foreign investment in Russia, but warned that the country could not rely on outside money alone to spur its sluggish economy. 

 Zyuganov has repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to present a detailed platform.
