MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the presidential race. 

 The resignation, announced by Yeltsin over the national television, also sent the Russian stock market soaring and the ruble, the national currency, stumbled against the U.S. dollar. 

 Yeltsin made up his mind to step down Thursday night and skipped the state dinner in the Kremlin to consider the move, the Interfax news agency reported. 

 His resignation is expected to further boost the approval rate of Putin, who has seen his popularity skyrocketing over the past few months amid a federal military campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. 

 Yeltsin has already transferred the so-called nuclear button briefcase to Putin, government spokesman Mikhail Kozhukhov said. 

 The transfer is a constitutional procedure, as following resignation Yeltsin ceased to be the commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces. These functions will now be performed by Putin. 

 Putin, Yeltsin's appointed successor, has announced that he would participate in the next presidential race, now moved to March with Yeltsin's succession. 

 Under the Russian constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 90 days following the early resignation of a sitting president. 

 "Having resigned, Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) gives Putin an absolutely real chance to become the future Russian president," said Boris Nemsov, leader of the pro-Kremlin Union of Right-Wing Forces. 

 "Yeltsin has left as impressively as he came. This was done not only impressively but also with fine timing: after the parliamentary elections and before the New Year," Nemtsov said. 

 Pro-government election blocs made a strong showing in the contest for the 450 seats in the State Duma (lower house of parliament) on December 19, a result also seen as a plus to Putin's bid to run for president. 

 Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, also expressed the belief that Yeltsin's resignation will pave the way for Putin's race into the Kremlin. 

 "There are three months until the elections and I do not see any serious opponents to Putin," Interfax quoted Stepashin as saying. 

 Yeltsin left the Kremlin at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT) and went for his country residence in Gorky-9 near Moscow.
