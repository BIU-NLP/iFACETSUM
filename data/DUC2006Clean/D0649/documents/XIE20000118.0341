MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday. 

 A visit to China will be the first trip abroad of a new Russian president, Sergei Prikhodko, deputy chief of the Kremlin staff told press after Putin's meeting with visiting vice chairman of the Chinese Central Military Council, Defense Minister Chi Haotian in the Kremlin. 

 Prikhodko said that "in compliance with the existing practice in Russia, prime minister and president do not leave the country at the same time, and therefore it will be difficult for Vladimir Putin" to make trips overseas before the upcoming general election. 

 "Besides, Vladimir Putin considers it necessary to concentrate on complex issues of domestic policy of Russia," stressed the president's aide. 

 He added that there was a broad program of events with the participation of Vladimir Putin on the territory of Russia. "There will be a lot of such affairs," he said.
