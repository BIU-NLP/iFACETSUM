MOSCOW _ With President-elect Vladimir Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle. 

 But Putin has made it clear he will be in no hurry to decide everything. And in his first major personnel decision Tuesday, he caught the capital's attention with a change that he did not make: He decided not to replace Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. 

 Putin's move appeared calculated to give the impression that the Kremlin is satisfied with how the Russian military campaign in Chechnya was going, despite mounting casualties and an adversary that has stubbornly refused to quit. 

 The move also rewards Sergeyev for his loyalty and quiets the infighting with Russia's defense establishment over his post. 

 But Putin's decision also affirmed the status quo in a military whose lackluster performance in Chechnya has demonstrated that it is in urgent need of reform. 

 Certainly, Putin has moved cautiously since winning the election on Sunday. No one doubts that he will make good on his vow to build a stronger state after he is sworn in as president in early May. And virtually everyone believes this will translate into new faces and stronger authority for himself. 

 ``Putin's in-house definition of a strong state is a state where all the other players are weaker than his administration,'' said Boris Makarenko, an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies, a research center based in Moscow. 

 But so far, the nation is still waiting to find out what its new leader has in mind. Moscow is eager to see which posts might go to the ``St. Petersburg'' team of economic reformers who began their career with Putin in that city, like Aleksei Kudrin, the first deputy finance minister. 

 And many are betting that the current ``Kremlin group,'' which is linked to Russia's oligarchs, will be well represented. Mikhail Kasyanov, the first deputy prime minister, they say, stands the best chance of becoming prime minister. 

 The new government is also expected to include the ``FSB Group,'' officials from the internal security service, which Putin once headed and which is one of the heirs to the Soviet KGB. 

 On Monday, Putin met with Boris Yeltsin, the former president, who had anointed Putin as his heir apparent; presumably, they discussed plans for the new government. So far, however, Putin has gone out of his way to lower expectations and perhaps buy a little time. 

 Putin has warned the public not to expect miracles. And his public appearances have been relatively low-key affairs, like Tuesday's ceremony at which he handed out awards to military heroes, cultural figures and cosmonauts.

 ``The elections _ parliamentary in December and presidential now _ gave Vladimir Putin the political capital which was lacking in Boris Yeltsin,'' the newspaper Noviye Izvestia observed. ``Only Putin can say how he can now put that capital to good use.''

 With Putin focusing on the economy and domestic politics, security policy is one area that may see less of a shake-up. That was the case Tuesday with the decision to keep the 61-year-old Sergeyev, who has run the Defense Ministry for more than two years. 

 The announcement followed a meeting between Putin and Sergeyev about Chechnya and about plans to reform the military.

 Despite the Kremlin's claims of success, fighting is still raging near the mountain village of Tsentoroi and even in the Chechen capital, Grozny, which the Russians claimed to have firmly under control last month and where a Russian policeman was killed on Monday night.

 The decision to keep Sergeyev almost certainly does not reflect satisfaction with the ragged state of Russia's armed forces. Nor can the Kremlin be happy that the military failed to subdue the Chechen rebels before the presidential election, as Russia's generals had publicly vowed. 

 But the decision has a certain political logic. Changing ministers might be read as a sign that the Kremlin was worried about the way the war is proceeding. Russia's generals were loyal and all called for Putin's election. 

 The move also allows Putin to concentrate on building his economic and political team. 

 ``There was plenty of talk about possible contenders,'' the newspaper Segodnya said of the defense post. ``It is said that Vladimir Putin got fed up with the generals' tussle for this post and decided to leave everything as it was.'' 

 It is not clear how long Sergeyev will stay. Segodnya speculated wryly that he would keep his job as long the fighting in Chechnya continued. 

 ``But only if it does not turn into a Hundred Years' War,'' the newspaper said.
