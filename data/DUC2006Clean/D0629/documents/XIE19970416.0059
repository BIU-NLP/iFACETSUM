NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The rate of computer virus infection in corporate America has nearly tripled in the past year despite a significant increase in the usage of anti-virus products. 

 This was indicated by the results of a survey released today by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA). The survey also found that electronic mail is now one of the leading methods of transmitting viruses. 

 Virtually all medium and large organizations in North America experienced at least one computer virus infection firsthand, and the survey indicated about 40 percent of all computers used in the surveyed companies would experience a virus infection within a year. 

 Macro viruses carried in common word processing documents and spreadsheets were the biggest problem, representing 80 percent of all infections, compared to 49 percent a year ago, and the NCSA survey indicated the instances of macro virus infection had doubled about every four months over the past year. 

 The No. 1 virus encountered, by far, was the Word-Concept, which caused almost half of all infections reported. The Wazzu virus, another macro virus that infects Word documents, was responsible for about one-fifth of all infections. 

 Of the 300 survey respondents representing more than 700,000 desktop computers and 24,000 servers, the infection rate was found to be about 33 of 1,000 machines infected in any given month, and 406 of 1,000 machines infected in a given year. This is a significant increase from 1995, when the chance of experiencing a computer virus was about 10 out of every 1,000 PCs per month, the survey found. 

 While reporting the growing likelihood of computer virus infections in corporate America, the NCSA's annual Virus Prevalence Survey also reported that use of anti-virus software had grown from 60 percent of the machines included in the 1996 survey to 73 percent in 1997. 

 Computer users apparently agree. Nearly 43 percent of respondents thought the computer virus problem had gotten worse this year.
