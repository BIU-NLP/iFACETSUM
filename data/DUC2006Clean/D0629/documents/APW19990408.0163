FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- The man accused of spreading the so-called ``Melissa'' computer virus appeared in court for the first time Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or ``Yes, sir.'' 

 The judge advised David L. Smith, 30, of the charges against him and informed him of his rights. 

 ``You are charged with some serious offenses,'' Judge John A. Ricciardi said. 

 Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment. 

 Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and shut down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless dancer in Florida. 

 He is charged with interruption of public communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service. The maximum penalty for the offense is 40 years in prison. 

 He remains free on $100,000 bail. 

 Smith did not answer questions as he entered and left the courthouse. His lawyer, however, spoke with reporters and questioned whether the virus was as destructive as authorities allege. 

 ``Is this more akin to a graffiti artist or an international cyber terrorist?'' said Edward F. Borden Jr. ``Whoever authored the Melissa virus probably fits the former rather than the latter.''
