MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spanish computer experts have discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12, the day of the World Cup finals in Paris. 

 A spokesman for the Panda Software company said Thursday that the virus was "very complex and destructive" and could erase all data on the hard disk and automatically print unwanted documents to printers. 

 The virus, which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents, will show a flashing banner of "Vive la coupe de monde!" (Long live the World Cup!) on the screens of infected computers when a user tries to open an MS Word file. 

 A dialogue window will then pop up and the user will be asked to choose which football team will win the game, while the virus will be working in the background. 

 The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created in France as all of its files were written in French.
