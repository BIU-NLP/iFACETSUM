NEW YORK (AP) -- Proving more destructive than expected, the Chernobyl virus caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns around the world, though the effects were far worse overseas than in the United States. 

 The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted. 

 While experts were still tallying numbers, Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged Monday, and there were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. Officials said warnings there weren't heeded. 

 ``Arguably, this is the most malicious computer virus,'' said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing at Trend Micro Inc., which manufactures antivirus software. 

 Other experts disagreed over whether it was the most destructive virus ever. But many were caught off guard by the amount of damage and said it was much worse than the Melissa virus early this month. Before Chernobyl hit, several experts were quoted as saying they didn't expect it to cause much trouble. 

 The United States suffered far less than other nations, and experts credited widespread warnings and updated antivirus programs with helping avert problems in the corporate world. Home users were hit harder. 

 About 100 student computers were wiped out at Princeton University about two weeks before term papers were due. 

 ``The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives were rendered useless,'' Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon said Tuesday. 

 At Boston College, the virus affected only those students who did not install antivirus software distributed by the university last fall, spokesman Jack Dunn said. 

 Bill Pollak, spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said there were reports of at least 2,328 computers damaged in the United States. 

 But the numbers could be higher, since no company or computer user is required to report a virus attack, he said. 

 The virus is believed to have originated in Taiwan and attacks Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers. A company unknowingly distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet. When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other files on their hard drive. If an infected program was sent in an e-mail, the virus was passed on to the recipient. 

 ``Turkey was caught unprepared,'' said Mustafa Ucoklar, an electronics engineer in Turkey, where the virus infected computers at banks, an airport and state-run radio and TV stations, according to Turkey's Radikal newspaper. ``The warnings were there, but nobody took any notice of them.'' 

 South Korean officials also reported about 300,000 computers were hit in government offices, schools and businesses -- about 4 percent of the nation's computers -- in the worst attack of its kind in the country. 

 ``We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this virus,'' said Ahn Byung-yop, vice minister of information and communications. ``We need to strengthen our alert system and public education on computer viruses.'' 

 Schrader said the countries hardest hit have widespread use of pirated software and lack recent virus software. Chernobyl's existence has been known since last summer, and every major antivirus software package can detect and protect against it. 

 Also, the Melissa virus last month served as a ``very effective wakeup call'' in the United States, Schrader said. Many U.S. users aggressively updated their software and began to take computer viruses seriously. 

 ``Elsewhere it wasn't taken as seriously,'' he said. 

 In India, at least 10,000 computer owners reported being infected. Businesses, banks and publishing houses in India were shut down and information worth millions of dollars was lost, the Indian Express newspaper reported. 

 Local media reported that up to 10 percent of all computer users in the United Arab Emirates were affected; at least 10,000 computers were struck in Bangladesh; reports in China varied from 7,600 computers damaged to 100,000. 

 ``This was the country's worst computer disaster,'' said Ahmed Hasan, general secretary of the Computer Society in Bangladesh.
