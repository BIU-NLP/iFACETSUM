The first virus known to hit personal computers was called the Brain. Distributed via floppy disks in the mid-1980's, the Brain was relatively innocuous and easy to track. Today, there are an estimated 40,000 computer viruses, many far more harmful. Here are some recent viruses; all of them can be blocked by anti-virus software. 

 Chernobyl 

 HOW IT WORKS: Gets in via e-mail, floppies or downloaded software. The virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a computer's hard drive. The date April 26 _ the Chernobyl disaster anniversary _ triggers it. 

 IMPACT: As many as one million computers in Southeast Asia were hit by Chernobyl on April 26. Hundreds of attacks were reported in the United States. Many more computers may have since picked up the virus. 

 STATUS: Authorities in Taiwan identified a computer-engineering student at the Tatung Institute of Technology as the virus' author. His college punished him by giving him demerits, but he has not been charged with any crime. 

 Melissa 

 HOW IT WORKS: Makes its way into computers as an e-mail attachment and then sends itself around the Internet using addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book. Can infect Word and Excel documents. 

 IMPACT: More than 100,000 computers affected worldwide. 

 STATUS: Prosecutors in New Jersey have accused David L. Smith, a computer programmer from Aberdeen, N.J., of writing and sending out the virus. Smith has pleaded not guilty. 

 Happy99 

 HOW IT WORKS: Often arrives via e-mail, infecting computers once it is executed or run. To the user, the program looks like an animated fireworks graphic. But it can destroy data and make public confidential files from your computer. 

 IMPACT: Possibly tens of thousands of computers affected. Steven Trilling, director of research for Symantec's Antivirus Research Center, said his center had more than 3,000 messages from people submitting the virus. 

 STATUS: Author unknown.
