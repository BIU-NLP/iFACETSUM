NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer virus timed to strike Windows PCs on Christmas Day has yet to pose a significant threat because of its low prevalence, but anti-virus software makers are gearing up to help computer users combat it. 

 The new virus, named W32/Kriz.3862, is designed to damage Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT machines. The virus overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable. 

 Only two cases of the virus have been detected ``in the wild'' so far, said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager in the virus defense division of Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates, maker of the McAfee virus protection software. 

 Network Associates ranks the virus as a ``medium risk'' because of its low prevalence. Viveros said Network Associates would upgrade the assessment if more cases of the virus are reported. 

 The virus contains a profane, anti-religious message, Viveros said Thursday. ``That could be why it may hit on Christmas,'' he said. 

 Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command Inc., said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia and the Middle East. That virus did not affect Windows NT machines, used by businesses, as the W32/Kriz virus does. 

 ``This virus contains lethal instructions,'' said Keith Peer, president of Medina, Ohio-based Central Command. ``Unlike the Chernobyl virus, it can infiltrate a business environment.'' 

 Both companies have developed software that detects and disables the virus.
