JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer anti-virus experts in Jerusalem Sunday expressed their suspicion that a new, but even dangerous type of "I Love You" virus may have originated in Israel. 

 Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company, reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to a company spokesman. 

 Thus, the company had begun its internal investigation to check whether an employee of the company had written the virus code and distributing it, currently known as "NewLove Bug". 

 The previous "Love Bug" rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States earlier this month, affecting thousands of computers and causing disastrous damages. 

 The "NewLove Bug", a modified type of "Love Bug", is using the same mechanism to spread itself by sending e-mails to persons in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express software's address book. 

 At first look, the only difference appeared that the new bug randomly chose its attachment filename but always has a .vbs extension. 

 In a more sophisticated examination, however, it is found that the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will attaches itself to every file on the victims' computer drivers, while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only attacked selected multimedia files. 

 The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to one minute, wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a blank hard disc once attempting to reboot. 

 Moreover, the new deadly virus will also mutates and adds lines of code to itself upon each infection in order to prevent anti- virus software's detection. 

 All these characters had made computer security experts put the lethality of such "NewLove Bug" at the dangerous end on the scale of 1 to 10. In contrast, the original "Love Bug" only ranks at 5 on this scale. 

 Numerous experts had issued warnings here that anybody should be very watchful when he wants to open an e-mail attachment, especially with a .vbs, .vps, or .vns extension filename. 

 There were already infection reports in the United States, while U.S. experts had said that the most critical time will be Monday. Only if the damage does not prove to be too severe by then, could the computer business breathe a sigh of relief.
