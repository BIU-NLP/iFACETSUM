NAIROBI, Kenya _ Tanzania charged two men on Monday with 11 counts of murder in connection with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy there on Aug. 7. 

 The action contrasted markedly to a decision by Kenya, where the American Embassy was bombed on the same day. Kenya has sent two suspects to the United States, where they have been indicted, and diplomats suggested that the Tanzanian decision set up a potential diplomatic conflict with the United States and might hamper the investigation. 

 In Kenya, 236 Kenyans and 12 Americans were killed. Eleven people died in Tanzania. 

 With three FBI agents in court on Monday in Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian capital, the government provided no details beyond the defendants' names. But authorities in Kenya and diplomats said that one man, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, was interrogated in the fall about terrorist activities in Kenya, including a plot to bomb the American Embassy, and that he was wanted in Egypt for terrorist activities. 

 While living in Kenya from 1994 to last year, Ahmed's life paralleled that of Wahid el Hage, who was indicted last week in New York and has been accused of working with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier whom the United States believes was behind the embassy bombings. 

 Ahmed and el Hage, of Arlington, Texas, arrived here in 1994 and went into gem trading. They were interrogated in the fall, el Hage in the United States, shortly leaving Kenya, and Ahmed here. 

 It is not publicly known what prompted the interrogations, in which the two told of knowing bin Laden, officials said. 

 In his interrogation Ahmed provided details of a plot to attack the American Embassy using three vehicles, said a report last month in The Nation, a respected independent newspaper here. An American diplomat said Monday that the threat had been dismissed as not serious. 

 In Tanzanian Magistrate's Court on Monday, Ahmed, an Egyptian, and the other defendant, Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, did not enter formal pleas. Ahmed told the court that he did not understand how he could be charged because on the day of the bombings he was in Arusha, 300 miles north of the capital, on the border with Kenya. 

 One defendant indicted in the United States in the bombings, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, has said an Egyptian named Mustafa had led the Tanzanian operation. In a statement to authorities in Pakistan, Odeh, who was caught returning from Kenya on a false passport, also said he went to Kenya in 1994 on an invitation from Mustafa, according to a Pakistani summary of the interrogation. 

 In his interrogation by Kenyan officials in the fall, Ahmed said that he had grown up and gone to primary school in Zaire, later attending Al Azhar University in Cairo, where he received a degree in agricultural engineering. He said he worked in Kuwait for the Defense Ministry from 1980 until August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. He returned to Zaire to set up a gem business and did deals, he said, for Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's dictator, who was overthrown last year. 

 Ahmed moved here in 1994 and set up a branch of his gem business here, he told the police. He also told the police that he was well acquainted with Islamic radicals and provided them with details about a plot to blow up the American and Israeli Embassies. He said that three vehicles would be used to attack the American embassy, and that on Oct. 22, 1997, he and another man took pictures of both embassies. 

 The Kenyans passed that information to the embassy, information that the American diplomat, who insisted on anonymity, said was found not to be credible. 

 Egypt has a ``big criminal file'' on Ahmed, arising out of his terrorist activities there, said an official in Tanzania, who added, ``They have enough to bring him to trial in Egypt and in the United States.'' 

 Egypt has not requested his extradition and is not very likely to, preferring to leave the issue to the United States, a person in the Egyptian Foreign Office said. 

 The American Embassy in Tanzania declined to answer whether the United States has or would request Ahmed's extradition. Two senior diplomats accredited to Tanzania said they thought that Tanzania would resist efforts to have Ahmed or Hemed extradited. Tanzania, they noted, has long sought to assert its independence from the United States and other world powers.
