DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug. 7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy. Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi said. ``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' said Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania. ``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and are also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered it.'' He refused to elaborate. Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the other is a foreigner. He would not identify the foreigner or his nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was Sudanese. Twin bombings at U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Aug. 7 killed 257 people, 11 of them in Tanzania. More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam. ``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said, speaking in Swahili. ``They know who took the device to the embassy, and they also know some of the people responsible for the event and others whose roles have not yet been proven.'' He said the three informants had all participated in the preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now cooperating with the investigation. Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the bombs had originated in the Middle East, and were transferred by sea via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania. Similar reports in Nairobi said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by road. On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy bombings. U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 struck at targets in Sudan and Afghanistan that Washington linked to the bombings. The missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation Khartoum has denied. The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators believe was behind the bombings Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.
