CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man who was among 14 foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania has been released, Australian officials said Wednesday. Muhamed Hassan Qassim, a Somali-born Australian citizen, has been freed by Tanzanian authorities, said a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The department can confirm he has been released,'' the spokesman said. Qassim, believed to come from Sydney, had just arrived in Tanzania with his wife and five children to take up a position with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees when he was arrested by authorities investigating the blast. ``They've been checking identities and papers and he was caught up in that,'' the spokesman said. UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg said Qassim was arrested for not carrying his passport in a security sweep following the blast. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian man was not a suspect in the blast. ``To the best of my knowledge this Australian has been detained because he didn't have on his person a passport when he was stopped,'' Downer said. ``He does somewhere have an Australian passport but he didn't happen to have the passport on his person at the time he was questioned. ``I understand in Tanzania a lot of people have been stopped and asked questions by authorities, but there isn't any indication that he had in any way any involvement whatsoever in the bombings that took place.'' The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70, while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at least 224 people and injured 5,000. The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing include six Iraqis, six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen.
