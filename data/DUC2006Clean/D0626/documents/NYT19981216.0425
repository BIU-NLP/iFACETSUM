NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors charged Wednesday that the American Embassy in Tanzania was attacked by at least six men who detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks, apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion. 

 One of the bombers died in the assault, which killed 11 people and wounded more than 80, while another photographed the destruction before fleeing, prosecutors asserted in a new indictment returned Wednesday. 

 The indictment provides the first detailed account of the bombing on Aug. 7 of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It accuses five men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous bomb attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya as well as other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad. 

 All five of the new suspects are at large, authorities said, and each faces charges for which he could, if eventually convicted, face the death penalty in the United States. 

 The government announced rewards of up to $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or capture of the new suspects, matching a similar amount being offered in the case of bin Laden and two other associates. 

 The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the embassy bombings and bin Laden's global organization. Four of those are in custody in New York and two others are awaiting extradition from Germany and Britain. 

 ``Today's charges reaffirm the mutual and unrelenting resolve of Tanzania and Kenya and American authorities to find, apprehend and prosecute every single person who participated in the murderous terrorist bombings in East Africa,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference. 

 Prosecutors did not charge the two men who are being held in Tanzania in connection with the bombing. One of those men, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, walked into the American embassy late last year and warned authorities about a plot to blow up the embassy in Nairobi. American officials have declined to say why they are not seeking his extradition. 

 The government has previously charged bin Laden and associates with the bombing in Tanzania, but until now has provided few details. Previous indictments in the case have been much more expansive about the bombing of the Nairobi embassy, which left more than 200 dead and thousands injured. 

 In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two countries, under the supervision of members of bin Laden's group. 

 For example, the indictment describes a meeting between one of the suspects in the Tanzania attack, Mustafa Mohamed Fadhil, an Egyptian in his early 20s, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who has since been arrested and charged in the Kenya attack. It says they discussed a fatwa, or religious opinion, in which bin Laden called for attacks against Americans. 

 In June, Fadhil and another suspect in Tanzania rented a villa in Dar es Salaam, which became the ``bomb factory,'' prosecutors charged.. 

 Around that time, the indictment says, Odeh and other Kenya-based operatives were preparing in that country for the attack in Nairobi. 

 In June and July, the indictment says, the suspects in Tanzania bought a 1987 Nissan Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy, and a white Suzuki Samurai, in which the suspects would flee. 

 The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the indictment says. They also were said to have bought oxygen and acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries. Experts say these are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.
