NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has detained several people in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects. The detentions were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing, which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. Police in Tanzania earlier this week said they arrested 14 people in the almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which took 10 lives. A Somali-born Australian was subsequently released, presidential spokesman Geoffrey Nkulu said Thursday. &UR; The hunt, 3rd graf pvs
