DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A refrigerator truck transported the bomb that killed at least 11 people and extensively damaged the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the FBI said Friday. The driver of the truck died in the Aug. 7 blast. ``From the evidence recovered during the crime scene search and subsequent follow-up, it is believed that a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigeration truck ... was involved in the bombing,'' FBI agent Kenneth Maxwell said in a prepared statement. Maxwell, who is in charge of the team of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said the cab of the truck was white or beige and the cargo box was silver. Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried into the embassy compound on a water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood. Maxwell read the statement as Adadi Rajab, head of the Tanzanian Police Criminal Investigation Department, looked on. Neither took questions. But as he was leaving, Rajab told reporters the driver of the refrigerator truck died in the blast, and the death toll could rise above the 11 dead, all Africans, who have been counted so far. It was not clear whether the driver of the truck was among the 11 dead. On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans. ``A significant amount of progress has been made in this combined effort, and the investigation is proceeding with diligence and speed,'' Maxwell said. He said photographs of the refrigerator truck and a Suzuki Samurai car believed to have been used by bombing suspects are being circulated. He asked people who might have noticed either vehicle to contact police. ``It is only through this type of alliance between law enforcement authorities and the citizens they protect that all our communities become safer places in which to live,'' Maxwell said. Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11 counts of murder each. Investigators say Ahmed has been providing them with a lot of information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in the blast. Ahmed has told investigators he volunteered information on the Nairobi bombing to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam on Aug. 8 as well as to the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents. But investigators say he has denied having any information on or involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing. Investigators believe Ahmed is linked to both bombings. They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the explosive device that blew up the embassy. The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs. The FBI has linked Saudi Arabia billionaire fugitive in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, to both bombings. (rn/cm/sl)
