NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross said Monday it is investigating complaints of harassment from relatives of those killed in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. In particular, widows are falling prey to relatives who demand large shares of a 100,000 Kenyan shilling (dlrs 1,670) death benefit paid from a national fund as well as a share of marital property, it said. Deprived of their rightful compensation, and even family property by relatives, some women report they are homeless, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. ``Greed is global,'' said Al Panico, delegation chief in Nairobi. ``But it is extremely disturbing to hear from women already traumatized by the Nairobi tragedy, and now struggling to care for their children, that their plight is being worsened by those who would profit from their suffering.'' A total of 213 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed in the terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on Aug. 7. Another 11 people were killed in the nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania. More than 5,500 people were injured. A U.S. federal indictment alleges that four followers of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden plotted a far-reaching terrorist campaign to kill Americans, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Three suspects are in custody in New York, while a fourth is being sought. The federation is supporting a Kenya Red Cross program to provide medical and social assistance to those disabled in the bombing, as well as immediate families of bombing victims. About 1,000 people will be helped over the next year. (kjd)
