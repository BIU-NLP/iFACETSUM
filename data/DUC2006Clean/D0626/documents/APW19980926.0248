NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents have returned to a white two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said Saturday. An American couple, who refused to give their names, said FBI agents, who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug. 7 bombing, returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard and the exterior of No. 43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge of the Kenyan capital. The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil, one of four suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in the blast. According to a complaint filed Sept. 17 by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, Fazil, a native of the Comoros Islands off East Africa, rented the house from May to August and was later joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali. No neighbors, other residents, security guards or household employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil's stay. It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi investigating the bombing. According to the complaint, the bomb that destroyed the embassy was built at the house rented by Fazil, who is a fugitive. He is alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the bomb. The house is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the embassy building in downtown Nairobi. Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The latter two are in custody in New York. On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested Sept. 16 in Germany on an Iterpol warrant, was charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens. He was not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing. In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7, another bomb killed 11 people, all Africans, at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania. Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held by police in Dar es Salaam. Adadi Rajabu, head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian police, was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection with the bombing. One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them. Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the mid 1980s. Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the attack. (gw/sl)
