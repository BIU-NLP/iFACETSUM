WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects involved in the bombing of U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, have been brought to New York for trial, U.S. officials said on Thursday. 

 The first suspect, Khalid Salim, was flown by the FBI to New York, the officials said. But the exact date of Salim's arrest was not known. 

 The U.S. federal prosecutors said they expected the suspect to be arraigned at midday in Manhattan federal court. 

 FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and other senior U.S. government officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m. EDT (1700GMT) at FBI headquarters in Washington "to announce developments in the investigation of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania," the FBI said in a statement. 

 Salim is suspected of throwing a hand grenade to guards outside the Naairobi embassy at the start of the bombing attack, a U.S. law enforcement official said in Washington. 

 Another suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also flown to New York, according to a diplomatic source in Nairobi. 

 Odeh has been held by Kenyan authorities since August 14, a week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the day of the bombing. 

 The U.S. officials said others among the several suspects in custody in Kenya could also be sent to the United States for trial. 

 Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.
