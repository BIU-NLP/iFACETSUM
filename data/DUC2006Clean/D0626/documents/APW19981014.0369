DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ An Egyptian formally charged in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam has been providing investigators with a lot of information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in the blast, sources close to the investigation say. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11 counts of murder each in the bombing in which 11 people, all Africans, died. On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans. Ahmed has told investigators that he volunteered information on the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 8 to the British High Commission as well as the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents. But he denied having any information on or involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing. One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be further identified, said Ahmed seemed to know much more about international terrorism than an ordinary person would. In an interview Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed likened Ahmed to a chameleon. ``He shows you a certain color, but ultimately you find it is not his true color,'' he said. Investigators believe that Ahmed is linked to both bombings. They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the explosive device that blew up the embassy. The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs. Ameir dismissed a report in the current issue of Newsweek magazine that members of Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group posing as U.S. informants had gone to both embassies with phony bomb warnings to learn how their security systems would react. ``Such information would definitely have been passed on to me by my assistants, but as it happens, I had no infomation of that kind at all,'' he said. The FBI has linked bin Laden and Al Qaeda to both bombings. Other sources close to the investigation said security at the Dar es Salaam embassy was not high and that the bombing had, in fact, caught security personnel off guard. Ameir said the investigation has slowed down because the FBI has completely changed its team of agents in Tanzania. But he did say that investigators have determine that the vehicle that carried the bomb into the embassy compound was a two-ton Japanese-made truck purchased from Jaba Tanzania Ltd., a local firm that specializes in second-hand vehicles. Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried on a water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood. (rn/sl)
