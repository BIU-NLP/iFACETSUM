NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Ministry has warned that an upsurge in malaria cases is likely to happen in west Kenya due to the impending rainy season, the East African Standard daily reported on Friday. 

 The situation now is not worrying but things can deteriorate with the onset of the rains, Kenya's Director of Medical Service Richard Muga was quoted as saying on Thursday. 

 "We have put our staff on alert due to possibilities of an outbreak of the malaria epidemic," he said. 

 According to the official, medical supplies to contain the disease have been sent to the malaria-prone districts. 

 He said that a team of senior officials from the Health Ministry visited one malaria-prone district Thursday to assess the situation. 

 Malaria, one of the two top killer diseases in Africa, claims about one million lives in the continent each year, according to the World Health Organization.
