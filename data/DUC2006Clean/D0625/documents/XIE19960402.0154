NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japan International Agency (JICA) will provide an annual 90 million Kenya Shillings (1.5 million U.S. Dollars) to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) under a five-year aid package starting from 1996. 

 An agreement to this effect was signed last Friday in Nairobi by the Director of KEMRI, Dr Davy Koech, and the head of the JICA implementation study team, Prof Shunzo Chiba. 

 The money will be used for the research and control of infectious diseases project which will focus on research on HIV/AIDS, acute respiratory infections and viral hepatitis. 

 The Japanese contribution in this project will involve the development of human resources, the transfer of technology from Japan and the strengthening of infrastructure and capacity for health research. 

 KEMRI has since its inception in 1979 received assistance from the government of Japan through JICA.
