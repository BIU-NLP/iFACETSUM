NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and diarrhoea have killed more than 50 people in Mombasa and Malindi, Kenya's coastal regions, since the epidemic started over one month ago, the East African Standard reported today. 

 About 5,000 people from the area have been treated in various hospitals for the diseases, Coast Provincial medical Officer of Health S.K. Shariff was quoted as saying. 

 Cholera-related cases are still increasing because of the contamination of drinking water following heavy rains in Mombasa, he noted, appealing to all Coast residents to boil drinking water. 

 He added that the ongoing nurses' strike which has crippled most public hospitals in the country since last Friday made the situation more dangerous.
