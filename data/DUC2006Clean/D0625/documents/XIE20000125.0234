NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is reviewing its public health act in order to meet the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the People Daily said Tuesday. 

 The reviewed act will create an enabling and conducive environment in the fight against the killing disease, Kenyan Minister of Public Health Sam Onger Monday told a sub-regional meeting of the United Nations Theme Groups on International Partnership against HIV/AIDS in Africa. 

 The new act will address a wide range of issues concerning environmental, sanitary and housing problems, Onger was quoted as saying. 

 It will also address the current loopholes which encourage the spread of the deadly disease, the minister added. 

 Since the first case of AIDS was discovered in Kenya in 1984, 1.9 million of the over 30 million Kenyans have been affected by the virus. 

 It is estimated that some 500 Kenyans die of AIDS-related diseases every day.
