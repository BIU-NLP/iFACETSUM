NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- One out of 10 children in Kenya dies of preventable diseases before the age of five, the East African Standard newspaper reported today. 

 The children die mainly of malaria, diarrhoea, vomiting and malnutrition, J. Mati, Executive Director of the Institute of Reproductive Health and Research, was quoted as saying. 

 The growth of up to one-third of children under the age of five is stunted in the eastern African country, he warned, citing poverty as a key reason. 

 Infant mortality rate in the country stood at 67 per 1,000 in 1993 while the birth rate was at 46 per 1,000 and total fertility rate 5.4 percent, he quoted the latest available data as saying. 

 Mati also called for a review of the government's policy on health framework which he said should comprehensively improve donor co-ordination in the prevention of diseases.
