JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A five-member specialist team from South Africa left for Nairobi Thursday to help Kenyan authorities investigate the serious outbreak of Rift Valley fever in that country, South African Foreign Ministry said. 

 The experts from the South African Institute for Virology were expected to stay in Kenya for about a week to do field investigations and collect specimens to be sent back to South Africa for testing in specialist laboratories. 

 The Foreign Ministry decided to provide financial support for the team following a request from the Kenyan medical authorities and the World Health Organization, a statement of the ministry said. 

 It said the assistance was "a reflection of the commitment of the South African government to cooperate with fellow African countries in eradicating infectious diseases on our continent and thus ensuring a better quality of life for all its inhabitants." 

 Rift Valley viral/hemorrhagic fever broke out after heavy rains and floods in Kenya.
