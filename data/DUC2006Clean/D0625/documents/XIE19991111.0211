NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Almost 80 percent of hospital beds in Kenya's government hospitals are occupied by AIDS patients, a senior health official has said. 

 G.B. Galgalo, Assistant Minister for Health made the remarks Wednesday when he closed a two-day AIDS workshop in Eldoret, southwest Kenya. 

 More Kenyan risk contracting the dreaded AIDS disease if measures are not taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic, Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted the official as saying. 

 Galgalo added that the AIDS cases are increasing at an alarming rate, noting that the number of AIDS-created orphans have now reached a million and this will impact badly on the country's economy. 

 It is said that the AIDS threat has reached disaster proportions with both private and public organizations incurring costs of as high as 200 million shillings (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) daily on HIV/AIDS- related expenses. 

 According to media reports, 14 out of every 100 Kenyans are infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, and nearly 500 Kenyans die of AIDS everyday. 

 Research by the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control indicates that more than 1.9 million adults and 100,000 children in Kenya are infected with HIV/AIDS.
