NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Department of Public Health will this month install condom dispensing slots in all public places in Isiolo district in an effort to fight the spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. 

 The dispensing slots will be installed in bars, hotels and lodging houses free of charge, the Kenya News Agency reported this evening. 

 Local District Public Health officer Wilered Mwai said since Aids has become a threat in the district, the most effective way of fighting it is to avail condoms to the public. 

 He made the remarks during the opening of a two-day workshop for public health technicians in his district. The theme of the workshop is "promotion and use of condoms to prevent AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases among rural communities". 

 Participants were challenged to educate rural people on proper usage of condoms because many cases are being reported in rural areas, the report said.
