NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy among Kenyans will be reduced to 42 years by 2010 from currently 58, if the AIDS scourge is not fought seriously, a UNICEF official warned here Sunday. 

 The Unitd Nations Children's Fund representative to Kenya, Chrispin Wilson, said his organization had declared war on AIDS and it was time the church in Kenya joined in to save its congregation from the scourge, the East African Standard reported Monday. 

 With 80 percent of Kenyans being Christians, Wilson said, the church must play its part and help eradicate AIDS. 

 He said that in Nyanza Province in southwestern Kenya, 30-35 percent of adults have the HIV virus that cause Aids. Some villages in the province have been abandoned as the old moving to safer areas, with the middle-aged group wiped out. 

 He praised Kenyan President Moi's call on everybody to protect themselves against Aids. 

 Wilson noted that if Kenyans could reduce sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS could be reduced by at least 40 percent in the eastern African country.
