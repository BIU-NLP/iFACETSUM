NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is expected to reduce Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) by 14.5 percent by the year 2005, according to a latest analysis released by the Ministry of Planning and National Development of Kenya available hereTuesday. 

 The analysis, compiled by the Long Rang Planning Division of the ministry, said the cost of treatment for AIDS patients in 2000 will equal the entire 1993/1994 recurrent budget of the Ministry of Health. 

 Statistics from the ministry showed that one in seven workers in Kenya is HIV-positive and this figure would increase to a four to one ratio, the Eastern African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday. 

 "One in every three deaths in Kenya's sugar sector is currently caused by AIDS. As a result sugar firms are losing highly skilled workers," Director of Planning Kang'ethe Gitu in the ministry said last week. 

 Experts at the ministry predicted that as AIDS related diseases and deaths take their toll, small scale farming will decline sharply due to lack of laborers. 

 According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, some 1.5 million Kenyans are HIV-positive. One out of nine persons is infected with the killer virus among the age group between 15 to 49.
