ATLANTA _ At rural schoolhouses and sprawling urban campuses across the country, millions of students returning to class in the next few weeks will encounter a steely array of new security measures. In many schools, lockers are being removed, cameras are being installed as hallway monitors, and students will have to swipe a computerized ID card just to get in the door. 

 Even as new statistics show that school violence is actually on the decline, the lurid images from armed assaults by students this year have prompted most school districts to take some kind of forceful action to instill a sense of greater security. That inclination can only be strengthened by the shooting at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 

 Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds. In dozens of locales as disparate as Pittsburgh and Palm Beach County, Fla., SWAT teams have spent the summer learning the layouts of high schools and conducting drills involving mock hostage-taking. 

 And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to conceal a weapon. 

 Some districts, by contrast, have rejected the idea of detection systems, finding them an affront to educational openness, and are concentrating instead on a drumbeat of programs to make students feel more responsible for their school's safety and less reluctant to report violations. 

 The new policies vary widely, but virtually all are a direct reaction to the shootings this spring at high schools in Littleton, Colo., and here in Georgia, in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers. Many administrators who say they have never received a threat of bombing or gunfire have nonetheless felt obliged to reassure parents and students that steps have been taken to reduce the chances that their school is the next to be encircled by news helicopters. 

 ``Everyone feels the need to do something, even though no one agrees on what that should be,'' said Joe Schneider, deputy executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, which represents superintendents. ``You can't just tell parents that you're doing more of the same.'' 

 There are indications, however, that security measures and counseling programs gradually undertaken before the shootings this spring have proved increasingly effective. In a report issued this week, the U.S. Department of Education, having compiled statistics from each of the states, found that gun-related expulsions in the last school year dropped by nearly a third from the previous year. Another study, issued last week by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that violence committed by teen-agers had declined during the 1990s, along with the number of weapons carried to school. 

 But administrators know that such studies are of little comfort to parents who have learned that violence can erupt anywhere, at any moment. Indeed, taken as a whole the new policies seem intended as much to instill peace of mind as to actually keep a student from opening fire on his school, prevention of which many officials say is probably impossible in any case. A doorway metal detector, for example, can do little to forestall a blaze of gunfire in the schoolyard. 

 ``It's not that districts are taking these steps solely to reassure people, but there's often as much reassurance built into them as actual effectiveness,'' said Dennis Lewis, director of school public safety in Springfield, Mo., and vice president of the National Association of School Safety and Law Enforcement Officers. ``Parents will call up and ask if a school has metal detectors. All of us know that no metal detector is going to stop someone who wants to shoot in a school. But a parent wants to hear that they're there.'' 

 Many districts conducted highly publicized drills over the summer in which police SWAT teams entered schools to put down mock shootings. Last month in Palm Beach County, Fla., for example, drama students with fake wounds pretended to be casualties as officers stormed a school and ``arrested'' police academy recruits who were pretending to take hostages and plant bombs, all under the gaze of television cameras. A similar drill at a Pittsburgh high school on Wednesday, complete with helicopters and ersatz pipe bombs, was so realistic that some summer students believed that police were responding to an actual attack. The exercises provided useful training to police in the unfamiliar territory of a school building, while also sending a message of control to parents and teachers. 

 Schneider, of the superintendents' group, said the shaping of a new relationship with the local police department was probably the most common step adopted by the nation's school districts. After it became known that the Littleton Police Department had been unfamiliar with the layout of Columbine High School, where 12 students and a teacher were killed by two young gunmen on April 20, many districts began distributing floor plans and computerized blueprints of their schools to their police departments, which in turn began touring the schools over the summer. 

 The most aggressive districts are erecting virtual walls around their schools, as if trying to keep the outside world at bay. In Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas that cut back its class schedule last spring after a series of bomb threats, officials are spending $1 million to bring in metal detectors, surveillance cameras and a new security force, and are requiring students to wear identification badges. In Deltona, Fla., near Orlando, lockers have been removed and book bags banned; students will get a duplicate set of books to keep at home. Many schools are installing caller ID on their telephones so they can trace bomb threats.

 In Owensboro, Ky., all but the front doors of public schools have been permanently locked, and visitors and latecomers must be buzzed in with a new security system that alerts the office whenever anyone approaches the door. Video cameras are being installed on school buses in Clayton County, Ga., southeast of Atlanta. Columbine High School itself will install emergency alarms throughout the building, and will be employing dogs to search for weapons and explosives. 

 Proponents of such measures consider them effective deterrents, a tangible reflection of a school's insistence on safety. John Coleman, director of safety and security for the public schools of Kansas City, Mo., said his district had not had a single shooting or knifing since it installed metal detectors in middle and high schools seven years ago. Similar results are reported in Dallas. 

 But support for the fortress approach to security is hardly universal. Methods of security tend to vary as broadly as parenting techniques, reflecting a lack of consensus on the best ways to reduce violence. Most of the districts in the Los Angeles-Orange County area, for example, have chosen not to spend money on new electronic security systems or guards, relying instead on the random checks with hand-held metal detectors that they have used for several years. 

 Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said the city's schools were far too large to check every student entering the building without cutting into class time. But as a result of the Columbine shooting, he said, the district will be putting up thousands of signs around its 670 schools that read: ``Making threats is no joke. All threats will be taken seriously and will subject anyone making them to any and all applicable criminal and civil penalties, as well as school discipline, including expulsion.'' 

 Many administrators believe that increased physical security is futile and counterproductive, noting that Columbine High had security guards and that Heritage High, the school in Conyers where a 15-year-old gunman wounded six other students on May 20, had surveillance cameras. Instead, these administrators have begun conducting intensive seminars to train students and teachers to recognize and defuse threats before they lead to violence. 

 ``We don't want to create an image of a police state, and we don't want dogs sniffing around,'' said Dr. Francis Connor, superintendent of the Dighton-Rehoboth regional schools, a small district in southeastern Massachusetts. ``By addressing the physical changes, you are only dealing with the symptom of the problem.'' Walled-in students, Connor said, tend to begin feeling isolated and outside the mainstream. 

 Connor's district has prepared a guide to alert teachers to the symptoms of students prone to violence. And many districts will hold meetings with all students to impress on them a new seriousness about security, and encourage them to report even jocular-sounding threats made by other students. (Several students at Heritage High School have said they knew that the teen-age gunman there had talked of emulating the youths who opened fire at Columbine High a month earlier.) 

 ``Almost every time a kid brings a weapon to school, he winds up showing it to someone else,'' said Jim Kelly, the chief of the school police in Palm Beach, where a pipe bomb was discovered at a senior prom in May. ``We're trying to help the kids understand that if they see that, they're doing their friend a favor by reporting it, maybe saving them from some prison time. We've got anonymous hot lines set up, and we want them to feel like they're a part of what we're doing.'' 

 In Shrewsbury, a suburb of Worcester, Mass., school officials are working with architects to design a new high school, scheduled to open in three years, which will have fewer entrances than the current building and a community liaison office where students and members of the staff can meet with counselors and police officers to talk about school security issues. The new building will not, however, be equipped with any metal detectors. 

 Daniel Gutekanst, the principal of Shrewsbury High School, said anyone could evade a metal detector, but not necessarily a system of adults and students working together to spot threats. 

 ``It sounds a little corny,'' he said, ``but the issue is not getting metal detectors, it's making sure you have mental detectors.''
