JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- A year after two heavily armed boys pulled a fire alarm and shot students filing out of Westside Middle School, killing four girls and a teacher, the superintendent talks about keeping a ``cloak of safety'' around his 75-acre campus. 

 Shrubs are cut back and a wooden fence now sets off the campus. A uniformed officer teaches Arkansas criminal law and acts as student confidante. School counselors are on duty every day. 

 The district is functioning normally, says Superintendent Dick Young, though it doesn't use alarms for fire drills anymore. He won't allow visitors in the hallways, saying children may be reminded what happened March 24, 1998. 

 ``We're in that gulf between wanting to remember and wanting to forget,'' Young says. 

 Students Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson and Britthney Varner and teacher Shannon Wright were cut down in the brief outburst of gunfire. A memorial garden is being built at the spot where they fell. 

 The shootings in Jonesboro and at schools in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville, Tenn.; Springfield, Ore.; and Richmond, Va., alarmed the nation last year. President Clinton called the outbreak ``a terrible tragedy'' and noted ``the awful specter of students being killed by other young people at schools.'' 

 Ronald Stephens of the California-based National School Safety Center told a House subcommittee after the Jonesboro shootings: ``It should not require an act of courage for parents to send their children to school.'' 

 On Wednesday, the first anniversary of the Jonesboro shootings, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., plans to introduce for a second time the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act. The legislation never came to a vote last year. 

 McCarthy says the bill would help prosecute people who sell guns to children, require gun owners to keep guns away from children and finance violence awareness programs in schools. 

 In the Senate, Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and John Chafee, R-R.I., will make another run at the Child Access Prevention bill. The bill holds adults liable when children use improperly stored firearms to kill or injure others. 

 Stephens says some 20 states have laws calling for school safety plans and many have set up hot lines for anonymous tips on disturbing behavior by students, tightened access to campuses and improved screening for school visitors. 

 ``In my view, the schools are safer than they were a year ago because we've had a heightened need to be vigilant,'' he says. 

 Suzann Wilson, who lost her 11-year-old daughter, Britthney, knows of the changes at Westside but says more should be done to make students feel safe. Class sizes should be smaller, students should be taught how to deal with their anger and schools should have more counselors. 

 Wilson says her 14-year-old daughter, Brandi, is still afraid to go to school. And for Wilson's part, ``there's not a day goes by that I don't think that she's going back to where her sister got killed,'' she says. 

 In Mississippi, where Pearl High School student Luke Woodham was convicted of killing two classmates and wounding seven others after first killing his mother Oct. 1, 1997, the Legislature passed a law broadening the death penalty to include killings on school campuses. 

 In Kentucky, student Michael Carneal received a life sentence after pleading guilty but mentally ill in the shooting deaths of three students at Heath High School near Paducah on Dec. 1, 1997. McCracken County School District, home to Heath High, now posts armed security guards, requires student identification tags and searches for weapons in its schools. In Lexington, Ashland and other places, anonymous tip lines were set up to report guns or drugs brought to schools. 

 In Virginia, where 14-year-old Quinshawn Booker wounded a teacher and a 74-year-old school volunteer last June 15, Gov. Jim Gilmore has released $1.5 million to put some 45 additional police officers in schools. Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance cameras. Booker pleaded guilty to five counts and was required to complete a program at a school for troubled youths, then be on probation until age 21. 

 Wilson has forcefully lobbied the Arkansas Legislature to hold gun owners liable if they leave unlocked guns where children can get them. She also wants to prohibit juveniles from owning guns after their release from detention centers. 

 A heated exchange with gun advocates on the state Capitol steps Feb. 1 brought Wilson to tears. But the confrontation did not diminish her resolve. 

 ``It keeps me directed,'' Wilson says. ``It's something to focus on. If I didn't have this, then I would have to stop and think about what I lost.'' 

 While Arkansas legislators debated her proposals and other measures, Andrew Golden, 12, and Mitchell Johnson, 14, remained in custody at a juvenile prison 20 minutes away. The boys, 11 and 13 at the time of the shootings, were found delinquent in the five killings and the wounding of 10 others. They are due to be released at age 18. 

 ``We really have not had any major problems with either boy. They have not been difficult juveniles for us,'' says Joe Quinn, spokesman for the Human Services Department, which oversees juvenile corrections. 

 Jonesboro is marking the sad anniversary with two gatherings at 12:40 p.m., the time of the shootings-- one at the school, the second at the courthouse. Wilson says Brandi will sing at the courthouse, and afterward the family will visit the cemetery where Britthney is buried.
