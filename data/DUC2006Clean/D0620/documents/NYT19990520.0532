CONYERS, Ga. _ Exactly one month after the fatal shootings in Littleton, Colo., a suicidal high school student, angry over breaking up with his girlfriend, turned his anger on the world Thursday, shooting six of his classmates and emotionally scarring countless others. 

 No one was killed at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, a middle-class community about 25 miles east of Atlanta. Five victims suffered minor injuries, and a 15-year-old, Stephanie Laster, underwent surgery after a bullet struck her in the buttocks and entered her intestines. 

 According to witnesses, the 15-year-old unleashed a barrage of bullets into a crowd of students waiting for school to start. Known to talk big about his guns, friends said, the boy started shooting at about 8 a.m. into a crowd of about 300 students in the lobby near the cafeteria. Authorities say he was looking to shoot the boy who had stolen his girl, though that person was not in sight. 

 The troubled youth surrendered in tears minutes after firing. By the end of the day, he was charged with aggravated assault. As the rapid-fire shots ruptured the morning calm, panicked students dropped to the floor, leapt behind tables, or ran out the doors. 

 ``It was a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' sophomore Kylie Forrester said, describing the gunshots that chased the students outside. 

 ``The whole school, everybody, was just roaring out of the school,'' said Amy Ladd, 16. 

 Even in the cautious wake of Columbine, some signs of trouble were seen and apparently ignored at Heritage. The day before the shootings, classmate Nathaniel Deeter heard the distraught youth speaking of his failed romance, saying he wanted to take his own life. 

 A week ago he spoke of bringing a gun to school. ``I told him it was stupid,'' said Deeter, who didn't think enough of the threat to tell school administrators. 

 Lately the troubled boy's grades and his relationship with his parents were suffering, and he had told several fellow students he carried a handgun. 

 Police say he rode on the school bus with the .22-caliber rifle stuffed in a book bag. He had sawed off much of the wooden stock to make it fit. 

 Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read said one charge of aggravated assault was filed in Juvenile Court against the suspect. 

 He said he expected that multiple aggravated assault charges, possibly as many as 30, will be brought in Juvenile Court. And he said he will move to transfer the charges to Superior Court, possibly next week, where the 15-year-old could be charged as an adult. 

 Outside the school, breathless students hugged one another for comfort. A half dozen linked hands in a circle and bowed their heads in prayer. 

 Some at first thought the firecracker-like clamor was a prank, coming on the last day of senior class, when yearbooks and prom pictures were to be handed out. The day before, 2,000 crickets were released in the hallways. 

 Deeter recalled chatting with his classmate 10 minutes before he started shooting. 

 ``I heard you had broken up with your girlfriend,'' Deeter had said. 

 ``Yeah, I'm real mad about it,'' came the reply. 

 The boy looked distant and removed as he spoke of the failed relationship, a romance of two years that had ended this week, Deeter said. 

 ``He looked like he was thinking about something else,'' said Deeter, who moved away. 

 A few moments later came the gunfire. ``He shot the kid next to me in the foot,'' Deeter said of the boy, who was wearing jeans and a baggy, blue pullover. 

 He seemed to be firing quickly and randomly. Deeter said he screamed at him: ``What are you doing?!'' 

 ``When he was shooting, it was as though he was looking right through people,'' Jason Cheek and Brian Barnhardt were shot in the buttocks. Ryan Rosa, a junior, was shot in the right ankle. Cania Collins was shot in the knee. 

 Drake Hoy thought the first shot was a firecracker. The second sounded real enough, and the third shot sliced into his left foot. 

 ``I started to run, but it started hurting pretty bad,'' said Hoy, 18. ``I took off my boot and blood was everywhere.'' 

 Teachers and parents got him and the other injured students to the front lawn, from where they were rushed to the hospital. 

 When he finished shooting, the former Boy Scout, described by students as quietly rebellious, dropped his rifle and backed his way outside. He pulled out a handgun and put it in his mouth. 

 Over the next 10 minutes, a few teachers repeatedly asked him to put down the gun and step away from it. The youth didn't say a word, as if in a daze, and kept the gun in his mouth. 

 Then a teacher walked up to him and said, ``Let me have the gun.'' According to senior Joe Watts, who watched from a window, the teen handed the revolver to the teacher. 

 ``(Assistant Principal Cecil) Brinkley put his arm around him,'' Watts said. ``The guy started crying and saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so scared.''' 

 That the shooting happened in suburban Atlanta, in a school known for parental involvement and good academics, has heightened fear in many parents, students and teachers. 

 ``Schools are no longer immune to guns, drugs and violence,'' said Pam Riley, executive director of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in North Carolina. ``But I don't think that all schools should panic and close. Then the terrorism will win out. What we need to do is provide ways for kids to do the right thing.'' 

 The shooting shattered what should have been a gorgeous last day of school for Heritage seniors. Some had thought of taking the day off. It was a sun-drenched morning filled with the promise of summer. Graduation awaits next Friday. 

 Several students said they had finally shaken off the anxiety that followed the killing of 15 people at Columbine High School in Colorado, a school similar in many ways to Heritage. Both schools serve predominantly white, suburban, middle-class neighborhoods. 

 Heritage High School was named one of the top 10 schools in the metro Atlanta area by U.S. News and World Report. About 80 percent of Heritage graduates go on to college. 

 The school has video surveillance cameras in the hallways and an armed sheriff's deputy on duty. 

 After the carnage at Columbine, Heritage was among many metro Atlanta school who felt the reverberations. Letters were sent out to parents assuring them the school was safe. But, like many schools, Heritage has endured bomb threats in recent weeks. 

 Though school will be closed at least today, many students said they would be frightened to enter those doors again. 

 ``I kind of thought it could happen here. It could happen anywhere,'' said Shayna McClelland. ``I don't feel safe here anymore.'' 

 ``No, I'm not'' going back to Heritage, said Julie Kull. ``I'm home-schooling or something. I'm not going back there.'' 

 She added, ``I just want to know why.'' 

 With television crews broadcasting the frightened faces of Heritage students, a collective angst swept through many schools and homes. 

 Principals across metro Atlanta scrambled to figure out what to do next and how to prevent a similar occurrence. 

 Some parents, already in a heightened state of concern since Columbine, suggested simply canceling the rest of the school year, bringing down the curtain on a year brimming with fear. Others called for metal detectors and more police in the schools, outcries that have been echoed for weeks following Columbine and the spate of bomb threats. 

 School safety has been catapulted to the top of the social agenda. After Thursday's shootings, Cobb County school officials are considering asking for additional police support in the schools. 

 Security was doubled at McCleskey Middle School in Cobb, with a sheriff's deputy joining the campus officer. At Cobb's Walton High, side entrances to the school were sealed off and visitors were not allowed on campus Thursday morning. 

 Charles Warr, principal at Sandy Creek High School in north Fayette County, plans to address the student body today. He said he will urge students to help keep the school safe by breaking their code of silence. 

 ``I'm going to tell them there's a difference between childish tattling and passing on critical information that someone is considering something serious such as suicide or murder,'' Warr said. 

 For now, the horror and fear and desire to stop such incidents has brought people together. That process began right at the time of the shootings, as students such as Greg Bluemling assisted a girl who had been shot. He and other students helped her into a room, where they applied pressure to stop the bleeding. A teacher came in with a first aid kit and they used gauze to stanch the bleeding. 

 Thursday evening, people gathered to pray at the Church in the Now's youth ministry, where they prayed for the students and the community. 

 ``I am definitely seeing the glass half full, and I'm so relieved we are not planning a funeral,'' said Bishop Jim Earl Swilley. 

 Gov. Roy Barnes planned to meet today with the families of students injured in the shooting. 

 ``It's frustrating not to have an easy solution,'' Barnes said. ``I want to give the people a solution, but this will take more than just me. This is not the time to have a knee-jerk reaction, but to ponder the long-term solutions that will work.'' 

 Thursday's crime claimed more than just six victims. 

 ``It was real heartbreaking, it really was _ even for the ones who didn't know who got shot,'' said Amber Barnhart, standing outside Rockdale Hospital on Thursday afternoon. Her brother Brian was among the wounded. 

 Some people say they've had more of these threats and problems than they can take. 

 ``It's springtime, when there are pranks and high spirits anyway, and unfortunately we have this horrible tragedy at Columbine hanging over us. And we have students who are perhaps unstable themselves,'' said Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators. 

 ``This school year cannot end soon enough,'' he added.
