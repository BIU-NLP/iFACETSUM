HOUSTON _ To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts, experts and educators say. 

 None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban schools. Experts say that's probably because they stress such prevention measures as metal detectors, increased security, school uniforms, parental involvement, alternative schools and conflict-resolution programs. 

 ``In the case of suburban school districts, they haven't had to think about this,'' said Joanne McDaniel, research director for the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C. 

 And it doesn't help, she said, when school districts that haven't had to deal with serious violence ignore the multifaceted problems that lead to incidents such as the murders of 15 students Tuesday attack in Littleton, Col. 

 Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms. 

 ``More than 70 percent of our schools require uniforms, which make it hard to hide a weapon and prevent the wearing of gang-related clothing,'' said Terry Abbott, Houston Independent School District spokesman. 

 Whether real or perceived, violence in the nation's schools has been an issue of concern, research and debate for more than two decades. When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon happen, some districts look, listen and search for ways not to become the next Littleton. 

 In the Fort Bend Independent School District southwest of Houston, administrators such as Mary Ann Simpson, the associate superintendent for community relations, are watching the TV coverage from Colorado. 

 ``Short of turning our schools into prisons, there is no 100 percent guarantee that you can eliminate this kind of thing,'' she said. ``But you can certainly look for ways to strengthen and improve what you have in place ... and listen to our kids, talk to our kids, especially those that seem isolated.'' 

 Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does have district police officers at middle and high school campuses, video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators. 

 Tonya Aultman-Bettridge, a researcher with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence in Boulder, Colo., isn't sure the school shootings in Littleton could have been prevented with better or more security measures. She believes school climate is more of a deterrent than metal detectors. 

 ``I don't think installing metal detectors and having armed police officers roaming the halls is the solution,'' she said. ``We concentrate a lot on teaching kids math and science, and we don't integrate things like violence prevention into the curriculum.'' 

 She suggested that districts foster an environment where violent behavior is unacceptable; teach students social skills such as anger management and empathy; and create a crisis plan and build partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services, parents and the community. 

 ``Schools don't exist by themselves,'' Aultman-Bettridge said. 

 McDaniel noted that the majority of the nation's schools continue to be safe places free of violent incidents. 

 ``We are still talking small numbers,'' she said. ``But we are talking serious rage, and we need to get to know our young people so that when they are feeling rage we can act to help, not just react.''
