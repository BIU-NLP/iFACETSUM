WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like many other schools preparing for this week's anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, Rich East High School in Park Forest, Ill., will have extra police officers on hand. 

 But Cmdr. Patrick Fitzgerald, a city police officer who coordinates school safety, said he's heard more from reporters writing about Thursday's anniversary than from parents and students who fear it may precipitate copycat violence. 

 ''Things have been very quiet out here,'' he said. ''When we take attendance on Thursday, we'll find out.'' 

 On April 20, 1999, two students at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. This year, education officials nationwide are taking steps to prevent their schools from suffering the same fate. 

 They've suspended students caught making threats, hired more officers and volunteers for the day, canceled classes or major school events and held meetings with parents and community members. 

 ''The date has them worried about a lot of copycats or kids who may try to send a very, very strong message,'' said Curt Lavarello, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, a group of K-12 school officers that has nearly doubled to 5,500 members in the last year. ''Let's face it, it's been absolutely clear in the tragedies we see on school campuses that these incidents can occur at any time, at any school.'' 

 On Thursday, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens will lead thousands in a moment of silence at 11:21 a.m., the time the attack began. But the school itself is on alert, with 24-hour police patrols and special badges for anyone wanting to get in. 

 ''Schools are under pressure to be prepared,'' said June Arnett, associate director of the Westlake, Calif.-based National School Safety Center. 

 The safety center, which advises school security officers, says its statistics show that youngsters are 99 times more likely to be shot and killed on the street or at home than in school. And this school year's 11 homicides and suicides -- even with the Feb. 29 shooting of Michigan first-grader by a classmate -- is well below last year's tally of 26. But multiple-victim shootings -- such as Littleton, Jonesboro, Ark., and Springfield, Ore. -- have nonetheless left schools recently guarding against or preparing for a major school-wide crisis. 

 For example: 

 --Four Anchorage, Alaska, students were suspended Friday after allegedly threatening to use guns and bombs at Wendler Middle School. 

 --In Rush City, Minn., high school officials suspended four students Thursday after saying the teen-agers threatened to take over their school and shoot it up on the Columbine anniversary. 

 --In Jay, Okla., where threats of gun violence prompted parents to pull their children out of classes Friday, police are expected to return to school halls this week, which also marks the fifth anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. 

 But some officials fear they may be overreacting to perceived threats. 

 The year since the shooting has left schools open to critics who contend they prefer SWAT teams to mental health counselors. Nearly two dozen schools have tested Mosaic-2000, an FBI computer profiling program that rates potentially violent students on a scale of 1 to 10. And hundreds of officers trained at R.U. Ready High, a school-shooting simulation at the Blackwater Training Center in Moyock, N.C. 

 These preparations are just as important as fire drills in keeping children out of harm's way, said Kenneth S. Trump, owner of National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based school security consulting firm. 

 ''You need some basic security measures in schools,'' he said. ''Why should we apologize for that?''
