GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff. 

 The only recommendation by the Jefferson County school district's Safety Task Force that was rejected, because of cost, was the addition of a second non-uniformed campus supervisor at each of the 16 high schools. 

 Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a police officer or sheriff's deputy. All will have one under the new plan. 

 Columbine students will return to their school on Aug. 16 for the first time since the April 20 massacre. Columbine seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with guns and pipe bombs, killed 12 students and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then took their own lives. 

 Other measures adopted Monday include: requiring visitors to get a school pass, the continued use of search dogs and the installation of a hot line and tip box to report incidents that might lead to violence. 

 Some task force members asked whether the measures would have stopped the shooting rampage had they been in place. 

 ``We found all of our recommendations can create some kind of safety in the schools. I think some of these recommendations could have prevented what happened,'' said task force member and Columbine student Sergie Gonzalez.
