DECATUR, Ga. _ If you walk into the middle of Shamrock Middle School wearing a blindfold, then take it off to study the signs on the corridor walls, you might think you're in the heart of scholastic darkness. 

 The signs warn students to stay in line _ or else. They spell out rules: ``Three bullying threats: expulsion.'' They warn against distributing drugs: ``Violators will be imprisoned.'' They list the ``parole proof crimes: murder, rape, aggravated sodomy,'' for 12- through 14-year-old students to ponder on their way to class. 

 How many of their parents thought they'd see the words ``rape'' and ``sodomy'' on middle school walls? 

 Shamrock is not a seedy, dangerous school _ far from it. If you turn from the signs to walk through the orderly classrooms, filled with neatly dressed students, or stroll around the surrounding Decatur neighborhood of pleasant ranch houses, the signs seem even more striking. 

 They are one glaring part of the fight to prevent heinous school crimes like last spring's Columbine massacre in Littleton, Colo. Just last week, a 12-year-old pulled a loaded .380 handgun on another student in the crowded cafeteria of a Fulton County middle school. Many schools have resorted to scare signs or metal detectors or surveillance cameras. 

 ``This is the way it is today,'' Shamrock Principal Tom Davis says with regret, by way of explaining the scare-'em-straight signs on his walls. ``It's nothing like when I was a kid in school.'' 

 Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic, may not offer the only _ or the best _ hope at preventing violence at school. 

 Shamrock and other schools, in addition to employing the ``hardware approach,'' also have launched a new strategy to make schools both safer and happier in the long run: what might be called the human approach. This tack relies on less visible, but perhaps more effective measures, such as developing mentor programs, broadening anti-bullying policies, bolstering the ranks of school psychologists and giving ``resource officers'' _ school police _ the interpersonal skills of guidance counselors. 

 ``We can't search every knapsack in every car, wondering if there might be a shooting in the parking lot before school,'' says Bill Modzelski of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the U.S. Department of Education. ``So we have to depend on prevention _ getting to the roots of the problem. And that means awareness of the kids' family structure, drug and alcohol problems, making sure someone takes responsibility to know if a child is happy or sad. Schools are so big now, kids pass through and nobody knows they're there.'' 

 HUMAN VS. HARDWARE 

 Metal detectors are uncommon in metro Atlanta, but they are credited with sharply reducing violence in New York City. Warning signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an oppressive air to schools. 

 Some students resent that cameras ``make everyone feel like a suspect,'' in the words of an Illinois high school girl who sent an e-mail to a chat room on school violence. And the camera will never be invented that can peer into a young person's mind. Witness the shooting at suburban Atlanta's Bear Creek Middle School, in 1994. On camera, security officers actually saw one boy ambush another, wounding him in the knee, but it happened so fast there was nothing that could be done to prevent it. 

 The locked-down mentality has even reached elementary schools. Dr. Stephen Pastan, 43, of Atlanta was taking his children to his old private grade school in suburban Washington when a guard stopped him at the door, issued him I.D. tags and tried to make him accept an adult escort to tour the school. 

 ``It was like visiting IBM _ I was put off,'' Pastan says. ``Maybe I'm naive about the real dangers but I worry about our children growing up without knowing what it is to feel free.'' 

 In the chatroom run by the Raleigh-based Center for the Prevention of School Violence 

 (www.ncsu.edu/cpsv/), Chris Bresky, senior class president of Clackamas (Ore.) High School, addressed the desire for a more human approach. 

 ``Metal detectors, cameras and K-9 task forces will not scare violence away from the students, it will only scare the students; if the violence is in the students it will get inside the schools,'' Bresky writes. ``The key is to connect with students, raise awareness through speakers, plays, candlelight vigils that there is violence out there and it can happen in their school.'' 

 AN UNDERSTANDING EAR 

 Programs that stress the human approach are in effect to some degree throughout the metro Atlanta area. But it's DeKalb County _ which began a forceful anti-bullying policy in 1997, two years before it became state law _ that's building a national reputation for innovation. The system's multifaceted security efforts were mentioned in Time magazine in the coverage of the Columbine tragedy, and are due to be spotlighted in a documentary on the A&E channel in March.

 Although the wall signs at Shamrock, a DeKalb County school, helped curtail a bullying problem a few years ago, Garry McGiboney, director of student relations for DeKalb schools, says it's the less obvious, more subtle, human programs that will make the schools happier and safer in the long haul. 

 Russel Parris agrees. The Shamrock student's grades _ and attitude _ have improved since he's received weekly mentoring visits at school from Fred Reese, an employee of a nearby BellSouth office. 

 ``When I need to get something off my chest, my mentor's there,'' says the 13-year-old, one of the 10 percent of Shamrock's 1,057 students who are mentored. ``He tells me, `Don't get mad, don't hit him, even if he was messing with you first.' It's good advice.'' 

 Jennifer Haygood, 13, adds: ``I can talk from the heart to my mentor, and I don't come in all mad-crazy wanting to blow up the school.'' She smiles as she says this. She just means normal modern frustration. 

 Principal Davis feels that mentoring helps students vent anxieties that might otherwise explode. ``That's one of the underlying reasons we have a safe school,'' he says. 

 DEKALB'S INNOVATIONS 

 You could see the human approach at work at DeKalb's Soapstone Center for the Arts the other day. A group of students age 9 to 18 was creating their own anger-management play to tour DeKalb schools. Just when the actors were about to erupt into staged fights, they stopped short _ took a deep breath, slipped on dark glasses and repeated the play's clever, cautionary tag line, ``Get in the cool zone!'' 

 DeKalb schools have broadened the definition of bullying to include not just physical intimidation but ``any kind of harassment that isolates a child,'' says DeKalb schools spokesman Spencer Ragsdale. ``Teachers are trained to look not only for the obvious victims of bullying, but to reach out to the kid who isn't picked for teams, who eats lunch alone. That's where the pain starts.'' 

 Policies on bullying are posted on the county's Web page (www.dekalb.k12 under ``What's New'') along with findings from a Norwegian study on bullying that was discovered on the Web. 

 DeKalb's school district also has been the most aggressive locally in enforcing the new state anti-bullying law, expelling at least 12 students since August and sending them for a semester or two to alternative schools where the student-teacher ratio is lower, and the number of psychology-based courses, such as decision-making and anger management, is higher. 

 ``Kids have access to so much violent entertainment, spend so much time in a world where conflicts are resolved with a gun,'' says Kevin Dwyer of the National Association of School Psychologists. ``That's why adolescent bullying, which has always been with us, escalates so much more dangerously now than it did in 1960 or even 1980.'' 

 A CRUCIAL GAME OF HOOPS 

 The human approach to preventing violence is not limited to DeKalb. Across the nation, school cops are making more effort to connect, to understand students' feelings, says Curt Lavarello, head of the police officers' Florida-based national association. 

 Sean Burke, resource officer at Lawrence (Mass.) High School _ where a girl recently slashed another girl's face with a knife _ tells of joining in on an after-school basketball game and getting to know a boy who was almost frighteningly silent and intense. After months of gentle encouragement the boy revealed his secret: He took off his shirt to display a back full of ugly welts. 

 There was more. The father who whipped him also had sexually abused him. 

 Burke, his voice cracking with emotion, says, ``There's tremendous pressure in these kids today. You need to help them get it out.'' 

 Connecting with students who hurt and healing them is more likely to occur when psychologists are a visible force in the schools, says Dwyer. 

 Dwyer, author of a widely respected study on the warning signs for school violence, says that when there is a ratio of at least one psychologist per thousand students _ as there are in only six, mostly northeastern states _ the reductions in violence are considerable. 

 The high ratio of psychologists and their active involvement in the curriculum of Tampa schools, under the banner Project Achieve, was credited for reducing violent incidents in those schools by 80 percent. 

 Georgia ranks in the middle of the states, with about one psychologist per 2,000 students. 

 It's the victims of bullies _ not the bullies themselves _ who are most likely to commit the high-profile acts of school violence, DeKalb's McGiboney has found. 

 ``The common thread in these incidents is that the child feels isolated or ostracized,'' he says. ``That feeling may begin at home. A 13-year-old kid left in his room with a ton of entertainment equipment, or dropped at the mall to hang out all afternoon _ that's not independence. That's isolation. Parents need to talk to their kids and offer support before that anger grows.'' 

 Indeed, reaching parents _ persuading them that bullying isn't a necessary rite of passage to toughen a kid's hide _ is almost as big a challenge as reaching students, McGiboney says. When addressing parents' groups, he begins by asking how many were bullied as youngsters, and almost everyone's hand goes up. 

 ``Then I ask, `How many still think about that bullying today?' and nearly every hand stays up,'' McGiboney says. ``I think that makes my point.''
