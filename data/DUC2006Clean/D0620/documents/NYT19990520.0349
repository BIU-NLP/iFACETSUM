At graduation Friday night (May 21) at Hobbton High School in rural North Carolina, Principal Stewart Hobbs will wear a bulletproof vest. He will be guarded by a sheriff's deputy, and an expert marksman will be posted on the water tower that overlooks the football field where the seniors will receive their diplomas. 

 Everyone at the ceremony will have to pass through a metal detector, and the crowd will be peppered with plainclothes officers on the lookout for a potential killer. 

 ``I doubt anything will happen, but right now, the way things are, you just can't take any chances,'' Hobbs said in an interview Thursday. 

 Hobbs's precautions _ taken in response to a death threat telephoned to the local sheriff's department on Monday _ seem a fitting punctuation mark to a school year that can't end soon enough for students, teachers, administrators and parents. 

 In the month since the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., a sense of foreboding has enveloped schools across the country. There are nagging fears and whispered worries that the angry kid, or the outcast kid, or the quiet kid, or the heartbroken kid, or the kid no one would ever expect, might suddenly erupt in violence. 

 Just such an event happened Thursday in Conyers, Ga., 25 miles east of Atlanta, where a 15-year-old sophomore who reportedly had recently broken up with his girlfriend shot six fellow students then surrendered his gun and cried. None of the injuries appeared life-threatening. 

 Coming on the one-month anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings that ended 15 lives, the incident reinforced the growing _ some would say exaggerated _ perception that schools must now be considered danger zones. 

 Before Thursday's shootings, those fears had been fueled primarily by a rash of bomb threats that emptied schools and attracted widespread media attention, which by some accounts created a cycle of even more copycat threats. 

 Before Columbine _ where the two killers came armed with more than 50 explosives _ school bomb threats were usually ignored by the media in the belief that publicizing such events only encourages more. There is no way to tell whether such threats have increased since the April 20 massacre, or whether the public is simply learning how frequently they occur. But authorities on school violence said Thursday that the perception of greater risk seems to reflect a troubling reality. 

 ``One of the things we're all wrestling with is the question of where did all these crazies come from at one time? There's a feeling among some people that they were always out there, and were just waiting for a psychological release like Columbine so they could carry out their plans,'' said Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe Schools in College Park, Md. 

 ``Schools are going to need to spend this summer trying to develop strategies to take a hard look at their populations, because they clearly need additional help,'' Blauvelt added. 

 In one case, authorities say, they have no doubt the Colorado shootings unleashed a murderous plan. The incident involved four boys arrested last week in Port Huron, Mich., for allegedly plotting to kill dozens of their schoolmates. Afterward, a prosecutor said the investigation showed the youths' goal was ``to kill more people than in Columbine.'' 

 At a court hearing, the local school board president, David Devendorf, pleaded for two of the suspects, both 13, to be kept in custody. ``You can't believe the fear out there,'' he said. 

 The reverberations from Columbine also have been felt in Allen, Texas, where school administrators in the Dallas suburb went so far as to cancel the last two weeks of classes after a dozen bomb threats in a single week. Criticized by some parents for capitulating to terror, school officials rescinded the closure and decided to hold some classes. Still, some parents were steaming. 

 ``They got overly alarmed and sent a message to kids that they couldn't control what happens in school,'' said Al Burke, whose twin daughters Jackie and Jessica are seniors at Allen High School. 

 ``Sometimes, the overreaction can do as much damage as the threat itself,'' said Burke, who runs a sports ticket agency. ``I don't think we should be sending our kids to school in the morning and telling them to watch out for the bomb that might get dropped on their heads.'' 

 No part of the country has remained untouched. In Lake County, Fla., the school board said a dog trained to sniff out guns and bombs would roam school hallways next year. A bomb threat in Phoenix kept 1,700 students home on a test day; a student who allegedly bragged about the feat was suspended. Maryland schools were paralyzed by a rumor that May 10 would be a day of violence. And in the nation's capital, all but one of the city's 17 high schools were evacuated on April 26 because of a bomb threat. 

 Massachusetts schools also have been beset by numerous bomb and massacre threats. In Cohasset, for instance, someone scrawled ``May 6 you will die'' on a boys' bathroom wall; nothing happened, but a quarter of the middle and high school students stayed home that day. Boston schools responded by establishing an anonymous tip line for students to report fears of impending violence. 

 Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the wake of Columbine. They said the Colorado killings ratcheted up fears because of the amount of firepower and planning that went into the attack. 

 ``With Littleton, with the mass destruction involved and the knowledge that such materials are available to students, the stakes were raised,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif. 

 ``We had felt like schools in the suburbs were insulated, and the message now is that it can and does happen where we least expect it,'' she added. 

 Despite the fears, authorities hasten to note that schools are extremely safe. Historically, fewer than 1 percent of homicides involving school-age children have occurred in or around schools, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Since 1992, the annual death toll from school shootings has ranged from 20 to 55, according to the National School Safety Center, including suicides. There have been 24 school shooting deaths so far this year, including the 15 in Columbine. 

 Joanne McDaniel, research director at the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., said the overall knowledge that schools are safe might have led to a sense of complacency before Columbine, despite past school shootings. 

 ``We've become good at identifying warning signs, but I think in some cases we're still too slow to respond. That's a sign of complacency,'' she said. However, McDaniel added, the response to Columbine makes it unlikely schools will take danger signals lightly anytime soon. 

 Patty Yoxall, spokeswoman for the National PTA, said her organization intends to use that attention to focus resources and energy on the problem before the 1999-2000 school year. 

 ``We're hoping to keep this issue at the forefront of concern for all of American society. Until we are really willing to address the problems of school violence as a society, we're not going to be able to effect lasting change,'' Yoxall said. 

 As for Hobbs, the North Carolina principal targetted by an anonymous death threat, he said the precautions he takes will not end when the last diploma is handed out. 

 A new policy at his school calls for all doors to be locked except for the main entrance; all bathrooms have been closed off except for one; more lights have been installed outside the school; and a wooded area behind the school is being cleared, to prevent potential attacks from being lauched from the dense cover. 

 ``I feel like every day I walk into this school I put my life on the line, and sometimes I sit there and wonder why I do that,'' Hobbs said. ``But it's the good days and it's these kids who come back down the road and thank you, and that's when you know why you keep doing it.'' 

 As he spoke, a group of about 20 high-spirited seniors crowded around him, begging for extra tickets to the graduation.
