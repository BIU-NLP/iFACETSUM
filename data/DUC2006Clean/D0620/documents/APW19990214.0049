INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A high school is scrapping celebrations of Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, worried that the ethnic celebrations will spark ethnic violence. 

 Inglewood High School, 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has been the site of tensions between black and Hispanic students. The campus was forced to close for a day last May after a riot broke out and dozens of police were called in. 

 A task force found that the fight in May began, in part, because Hispanic students who comprise about half the school population felt slighted. They were angry that a month was set aside to honor black history but only a day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. 

 Instead of celebrating Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers to follow a ``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year. 

 ``Let's talk about all cultures and contributions all the time,'' Winston said. ``This school has had racial problems that are unique ... the old ways didn't work.'' 

 February is marked by many schools around the country as Black History Month. May 5 is a national holiday in Mexico commemorating an 1862 battle in which Mexico defeated French occupation troops southeast of Mexico City.
