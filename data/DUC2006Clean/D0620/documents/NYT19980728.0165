WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes. 

 The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown.'' 

 The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention and resources.'' 

 JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to track it down, you're looking wrong place. School is about as safe a place as you can put your kids.'' 

 There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school year, the report said. A year earlier there were 25. But In the 1992-1993 school year, 55 shooting deaths occurred. In 1993-1994 there were 51, followed by 20 in 1994-1995 and 35 in 1995-1996. 

 Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase ``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994. 

 The report relied on data from the U.S. Education Department, the Justice Department, the FBI, nongovernment groups that track school violence and newspaper clippings. It defined deadly school violence as killings of adults as well as children on school property. 

 For instance, it counted the May 1998 shooting of a speech diagnostician by her jealous boyfriend at Stranahan High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 

 Concern over school violence reached its apogee in March when two boys, aged 13 and 11, opened fire on a crowd of children and teachers in Jonesboro, Ark. Four students and one teacher died in the hail of bullets. Similar incidents during the 1997-1998 school year occurred in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; and Springfield, Ore. 

 Many news outlets referred to each shooting as ``an all-too-familiar story'' or ``another in a recent trend,'' the JPI report said. Members of Congress and other officials ``reacted abruptly to what they perceived to be a huge swing in public opinion,'' the report continued, adding: ``A moral panic swept the country.'' 

 President Clinton has endorsed pending legislation to increase the number of police officers available to deal with juvenile crime. Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a Republican, suggested reducing the number of nighttime scholastic sporting events and after-school programs as a way of lowering the chance of violence. 

 Local school administrators also reacted. Two elementary school students in Tyrone, Ga., were temporarily suspended for pinpointing those they wanted to do away with, a list that included Barney the purple dinosaur and the British singing group, Spice Girls. 

 The report called all these reactions ``overblown.'' It said that ``everyday gun violence'' against children is a far more pressing concern. More than 3,000 children a year die from gunfire, said the report, quoting figures from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Children are killed in gun accidents at 23 times the rate they are killed in schools, the report said. 

 The relatively flat trend-line noted in the report appeared to be in line with data from other sources. The FBI, for instance, reported there were 25 homicides committed by juveniles under 13 in 1965 and 16 in 1996. 

 In a two-year study between 1992 and 1994, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that students had less than a one in a million chance of dying violently in school. By contrast, the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Program in 1997 calculated that overall, for every million juveniles, 38 were murdered that year. That's 40 times the rate for deaths in schools, the JPI report said. 

 The institute's study encouraged continuation of after-school programs as a way of ``productively occupying'' children. It also recommended gun restrictions, including the ``one-gun-a-month'' laws that limit the quantities of guns an individual can purchase. 

 Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., said the flat school violence trendline noted in the report ``doesn't mean a whole lot.'' 

 Although down overall in recent years, crime and violence in and out of school remains significantly higher than it was 40 years ago, he said.
