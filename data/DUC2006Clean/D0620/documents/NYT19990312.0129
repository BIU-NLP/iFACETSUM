MELROSE, Mass. _ Unless local school parent councils vote otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once they get home. 

 Dressed in a calf-length red velveteen coat over a black Amityville T-shirt, calf-high boots and with a casket-shaped purse slung over her shoulder, Melrose High school senior Erica Muxie was horrified at the thought of uniformity being imposed upon her. 

 ``It's a public school, you should be able to express yourself,'' said the spiked-collar sporting Muxie, who plans to study forensic science in college. 

 But Governor Paul Cellucci _ and dozens of school officials and politicians across the country _ argue the opposite: if too much attention is spent on looking sharp in school, learning suffers. 

 Cellucci proposed legislation Thursday that would require all schools to have uniforms unless their local parent councils opted out. This would effectively force each school to at least debate the uniform issue. 

 That debate has already been resolved in New York, where the city's 550,000 elementary school students will be required to wear uniforms this fall, following a school uniform revival that began in Long Beach, Calif. in 1994. About 10 states have some type of school uniform regulation, in addition to scores of individual cities. 

 In Massachusetts, several cities, including Lawrence and Springfield, have uniform policies, although they vary greatly. Lawrence and Springfield require students to wear them, while Boston allows its schools to choose. 

 ``With our proposal, Massachusetts will join a nationwide trend that has seen parents, teachers, principals and school committees work together to promote an atmosphere of safety and seriousness in their classrooms by regulating what students wear to school each day,'' Cellucci said. 

 The school uniform issue is far from new in Massachusetts, but still ignites enormous passion, no matter what the age of a student, teacher or parent. It was an issue in the 1993 mayoral race in Boston, and in the 1996 presidential campaign. In 1997, Gov. William Weld filed legislation allowing schools to require uniforms if they chose, but it died. 

 The parent councils Cellucci mentioned also include school principals, teachers, and, in some cases, community leaders and students. 

 Since Lawrence began requiring in 1994 that students wear navy blue pants or skirt and white shirt every day, ``I've seen immense changes,'' said Denise McCarthy, principal of the Wetherbee Saunders Elementary School. ``The children felt better about themselves. It gave them a sense of belonging to both the school district and the school.'' 

 Some parents say the uniform both prevents violence over clothes, and sets a tone of the classroom as a serious place for learning. 

 ``Kids fight over clothes, they steal clothes,'' said Carl Askins a Jamaica Plain parent of two children in Boston public schools, who sits on the city's Parent Council. He said he would want more information before deciding on a mandatory policy, but that the cost of being fashionable in public schools is an undue burden on many parents. 

 Kids, while largely negative on uniform policies, do admit they can work. Dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie at the East Boston Edwards School, where Cellucci made his announcement, Chris Hunt, 13, said ``everyone hates'' his school's uniform of khaki or blue khaki pants and white or navy blue sweatshirt. 

 But now, Hunt said, ``you can't judge other kids by their clothes.'' 

 Melrose High senior Muxie on the other hand said that if forced to wear a uniform, ``I wouldn't feel like myself anymore. So I would be less inclined to try to do well in school.'' 

 Before the 1960s, uniforms in public schools were commonplace, then largely abandoned in that free-spirited decade. It was as school violence and classroom disruptions increased across the country in the '80s and early 1990s that uniforms caught on again. 

 After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction in school crime and an increase in attendance. Chicago school officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform policies in many of their schools. 

 What courts may still have to decide in Massachusetts is whether schools have the right to make uniforms mandatory. In Lawrence and Boston, if parents protest the uniforms, their children can usually wear what they want. 

 ``If it is voluntary it is fine. When it becomes mandatory, it becomes more problematic,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. He said buying uniforms might provide a financial hardship for parents and the argument that uniforms can save parents' money isn't true. 

 ``They just go home and get out of them and put something else on,'' Roberts said.
