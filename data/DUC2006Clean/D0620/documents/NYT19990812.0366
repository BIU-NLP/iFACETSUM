NEW YORK _ The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., have led school officials in the New York City metropolitan area to reassess security and in some cases to make changes to minimize threats. 

 At one extreme is West Hartford, Conn., where administrators devised what they termed a ``lockdown'' drill in which students and teachers, practicing in case there should be a shooting, lock all doors and stay put until they are told that the police have arrived. 

 But a more common reaction is that of New York City, where the Police Department obtained blueprints of the 1,100 schools and asked precinct commanders to work with principals and superintendents on how to handle such an emergency. 

 Either way, the potential for violence at schools has weighed heavily on many administrators and has generated forums for public discussion in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been spared school shootings but not the heightened alarm. 

 There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents were reported. Shootings at New York City schools are rare; there has not been a fatal one since February 1992, when two teenagers involved in a feud over a gold bracelet were shot dead in the hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn just moments before Mayor David Dinkins was to arrive for a speech, said Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the board. That shooting led to the widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city schools. 

 Reacting to Columbine, New York state officials are requiring districts to report major violent acts _ bomb threats, explosions, shootings _ to the state Department of Education within 48 hours of the incident. 

 The regulation is designed to better track violence and help raise awareness among school officials and the communities they serve to the potential for violence, said Christopher Carpenter, a spokesman for the department. He said school officials who failed to comply could face disciplinary action by the state, which licenses principals and superintendents. 

 In the meantime, a task force headed by Lt. Gov. Mary Donahue has held public hearings across the state _ the final one was on Wednesday _ to prepare a report for Gov. George Pataki on improving school safety. 

 Likewise, New Jersey state officials convened public forums to gather information toward a similar goal, and local districts in Connecticut must report to Gov. John Rowland by September on how they have improved security. 

 Some people who work in schools are taking no chances. A conference on Monday sponsored by the Connecticut Association of Schools and Connecticut Center for School Change at Quinnipiac College in Hamden included agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation instructing teachers on how to be good hostages. It drew 225 people, the association's largest audience in four years.
