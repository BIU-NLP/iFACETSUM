JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African weather experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping to hit South Africa stronger than ever before. 

 Long-term forecaster Emsie Klopper said on Thursday that it was clear from current rain patterns that El Nino had arrived. 

 According to the Weather Bureau in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, the cold and rainy weather being experienced in most parts of the summer rainfall region in South Africa was not normal for this time of year. 

 It was an indication that global weather patterns were being disturbed by an El Niono event, the bureau said. 

 Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry conditions from November to March were correct. 

 The general El Nino forceast was that in South Africa and other countries in the Southern Hemisphere normal or above-normal rainfall would occur in the first part of the season with a drier spell in the second part of the season. 

 The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry said earlier that South Africa was in a better position this year than it was when the previous serious El Nino event struck in 1982/83. 

 South Africa's water storage levels at major reservoirs were the best since 1940 and there should be enough water to last through the normal duration of an El Nino event, the department said.
