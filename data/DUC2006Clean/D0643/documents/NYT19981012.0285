On Tuesday, ``Nova'' ventures on the track of El Nino, the mysterious phenomenon that every few years rages out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc around the world. Its impact in 1997 and 1998 is fresh in memory. 

 What happens when El Nino strikes is lamentably clear; the puzzle of why has sent a team of scientists, the focus of Tuesday's program, patrolling the Pacific with a long line of data-collecting stations. 

 What the scientists know already is that El Nino disrupts normal weather patterns: Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences. 

 In the 1982-83 El Nino, areas of Peru, which was hit first, received 30 times the normal rainfall; the flooding cost Peru some $1 billion in damages and 600 deaths. Worldwide damage came to $13 billion and 2,000 deaths. 

 Put in place in 1994, the El Nino detection system, perhaps the largest scientific instrument ever built, is kept afloat by buoys. Constantly monitoring the Pacific's winds and waves, the system's 70 stations can come up with hints of suspicious changes and may deliver an El Nino forecast, as they did in 1997. But what was predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper.'' 

 A result was destruction from Africa to California, where meteorologists can be seen flying smack into the storms to measure their impact. It makes for quite a show, and the only sure prediction about El Nino is that it will come again.
