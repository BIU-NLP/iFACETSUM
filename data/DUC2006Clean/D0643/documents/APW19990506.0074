Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina, the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the Pacific Ocean, scientists say. 

 It's part of the same widespread weather trend that dumped a record 91 feet of snow on Mount Baker in Washington this winter and triggered severe drought and wildfires in Florida. 

 ``The signal is there,'' said Steve Byrd, science officer for the National Weather Service in Omaha, Neb. ``The incidence of tornadoes on the central Plains is slightly higher during La Nina.'' 

 La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and influences weather patterns around the world. 

 It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters. 

 La Nina has generated a stronger, colder jet stream in the upper atmosphere, while warm, wet air at lower levels has been pulled from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains states. 

 This combination generated the ferocious thunderstorms that spawned dozens of twisters, including a historic F-5 tornado in Oklahoma City. An F-5 is the most powerful tornado there is. At least 41 people have died in Oklahoma alone as the result of the severe weather. 

 The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year. Most La Ninas last only several months, and there are signs that this one is beginning to wane. 

 The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that dissipated in 1998. Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino. 

 El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean. La Ninas, by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia. 

 This spring, meteorologists in Nebraska and Iowa already have tallied 17 tornadoes -- five more than normal by early May. ``We're already living up to predictions,'' Byrd said.
