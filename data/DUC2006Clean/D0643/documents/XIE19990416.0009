LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday. 

 Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have found that during the El Nino years between 1991 and 1994, the release of carbon dioxide from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of that in 1996, a non-El Nino year. 

 "El Nino clearly has a marked influence on the overall carbon dioxide flux," the researchers wrote in a letter to the British science journal Nature. 

 The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year. Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas, those where water is rising to the surface release the gas. 

 The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. 

 It is estimated that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is the source of 72 percent of the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from the equatorial oceans. 

 Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each year. 

 The NOAA team's new research helps explain the lower growth in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during those years. 

 The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of this "missing" carbon dioxide.
