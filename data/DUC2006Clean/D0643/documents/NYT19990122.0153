SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ El Nino appears to have been an active climate force since the time human beings developed writing, a geologist theorizes in an article published Friday in the journal Science. 

 The findings by a team of researchers add to a growing body of knowledge about the still mysterious El Nino, which has affected weather systems from South America to the U.S. Northeast. 

 The findings could add to research into how El Nino may have influenced civilization, and what it could mean for the future of a warming planet. 

 It wasn't an ancient Sumerian weather story that led Union College assistant professor Donald Rodbell to the discovery, but a 30-foot-long sample of mud taken in 1993 from Lake Pallcococha high in the Andes of Ecuador. The sample, originally drawn by Rodbell and colleague Geoffrey Seltzer of Syracuse University to study climate change associated with the last ice age, provided a natural archive of climactic information spanning 15,000 years. 

 The core, after some initial study, sat in a refrigerator for three years until researchers began taking another look at it, particularly its unusual ``zebra stripes'' of light-colored layers. 

 ``We didn't know exactly what we had,'' Rodbell said. ``In the back of my mind, I wondered if these patterns were somehow connected to El Nino.'' 

 El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns. 

 While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and anecdotal records to study, including when it began. The core gives what scientists say is the longest continuous record of El Nino activity. 

 Every two to eight years, El Nino manifests itself in warm ocean currents off the western coast of South America, affecting, depending on its strength, weather systems throughout the Western Hemisphere. Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific. 

 The bands of light and dark sediment in the sample, scientists say, document El Nino's active and quiet years. The light layers reflect non-El Nino years, marked by relatively weak rainfalls, while the dark, organically rich layers were caused by heavy downpours that washed more vegetation from upland areas into the lake. 

 Analysis with medical imaging technology found that El Nino appeared every two to eight years, the same frequency as today. 

 The research team found that El Nino was weak to non-existent around the lake between 5,000 and 12,000 years ago, but as an accompanying article in Science notes, other new records from western Pacific corals and sediment from the Great Lakes show El Nino was in action 12,000 to 120,000 years ago. 

 Scientists say that unlocking El Nino's secrets means more to humanity than knowing when to invest in umbrella stock. The torrential rains, according to at least one theory by archaeologist Daniel Sandweiss of the University of Maine, may have sparked temple construction and more complex civilizations, right after an El Nino lull that occurred from 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. While that theory had been challenged, the find appears to support at least his claim that the lull occurred. 

 The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming. 

 IN December, scientists from the Woods Hole Research Laboratory in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that during El Nino years that bring hot, dry weather to the Amazon, Brazil's rain forest sends out more carbon dioxide gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere. How that might play out in a world where human activity is adding to the so-called greenhouse effect remains unclear. 

 Rodbell, whose coauthors include scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of Massachusetts, and the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, cautioned that the results are only of one lake sample. He was recently awarded a two-year, $90,000 National Science Foundation grant to investigate other lakes in southern Ecuador.
