GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday. ``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update. La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino. By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the International dateline, WMO said. The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June. The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon. It has also brought rain to Australia. An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said. Last Sept. 24, four Atlantic hurricanes were active at the same time, the first time this has happened this century. El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east along the equator toward South America. During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns. The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida. La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia. Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia, ``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said. ``However, La Nina's relatively benign image may not be entirely appropriate,'' it cautioned. WMO added that uncertainty over surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which contribute to changing rainfall over Africa and South America, makes an accurate forecast difficult. But it said there are increased possibilities of below-normal rainfall in eastern Africa through next March. &UR; (gm)
