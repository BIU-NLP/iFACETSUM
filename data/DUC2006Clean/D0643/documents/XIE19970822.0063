JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino, a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, through a sophisticated computer simulation. 

 According to a recent report released by the Weizmann Institute of Science, the study was conducted by professor Eli Tziperman of the Weizmann Institute's Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department, together with colleague Harvey Scher and with Stephen Zebiak and Mark Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 

 El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six years. It disrupts weather worldwide, causing storms, floods and droughts. Its exact arrival, however, is extremely difficult to predict with precision because of its chaotic nature. 

 The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events. When they altered the values for the magnitude of deep ocean waves at a single point in the western Pacific, the model produced El Nino at regular intervals of about four years, with perfectly predictable cycles of temperature, winds and ocean currents. 

 While the scientists do not propose to control the actual El Nino, they do believe that the successful control in a complex prediction model may help them better understand the crucial factors governing El Nino behavior. This, in turn, may improve the researchers' ability to predict El Nino events and lead to measures that could reduce their global damage. 

 A particularly significant El Nino (Spanish for "The Child," referring to the infant Jesus) appears to be brewing in the equatorial Pacific right now, threatening to strike some time later this year.
