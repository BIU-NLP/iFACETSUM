SINGAPORE (AP) _ There was good news Wednesday from the world's weather forecasters: the massive disruptions caused by El Nino are coming to an end. The World Meteorological Organization said the current round of El Nino ``is in its dying stages,'' but conceded there was considerable uncertainty ``about the rate of weakening.'' El Nino, a disruptive weather phenomenon that returned in 1997, has been blamed for flooding in Kenya, drought in Indonesia and heavy snow in the southwestern United States. It has even been credited with lengthening the days on Earth by slowing its rotation. Unlike previous episodes which lingered for years, the current El Nino ``is showing clear signs of weakening,'' said the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency. The organization's update said the four conditions typical of the weather phenomenon are becoming less pronounced. Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of trade winds; and changes in sea level. El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas. It also helps trigger some man-made disasters. For example, fires set by farmers and plantation owners in Indonesia in 1997 and 1998 swept through unusually dry forests, shrouding much of Southeast Asia in thick haze. The World Meteorological Association (WMO) said it is difficult to predict just when this round of El Nino will come to an end. ``One model has conditions moving rapidly towards normal by mid-1998, and another has El Nino lingering on towards the end of the year,'' the report stated. During a press conference Tuesday, the organization's secretary-general Godwin Obasi, of Nigeria, said he expected the former scenario, with El Nino tapering off by the end of this month. Such a development could be followed by the so-called La Nina effect, which could reverse some of the effects of the current disturbances and, in Southeast Asia, help curb some of the forest fires. However, the international weathermen said it's far from certain whether La Nina will occur. The U.N. weather agency predicts drier-than-normal conditions over Indonesia, Micronesia and southern South America during the next two months. Wetter conditions than usual will continue over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern South America. John Miller, chief of the environment division at WMO, told The Associated Press that the forecast was a conservative prediction that discounted the possibility of an immediate end to El Nino or a La Nina episode. This was despite growing evidence to suggest such an occurrence, because forecasts rely on a consensus of results in the computer predictions.
