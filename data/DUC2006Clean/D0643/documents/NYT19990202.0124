&UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; When 1998 began, East Africa should have been at its most beautiful. Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but this year was different. 

 The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch. 

 At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds. 

 Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold snaps and heat waves. 

 Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino. 

 By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates. 

 In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered around the globe. 

 Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance. The bad news is that according to some research this latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the next century. 

 In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut off this wind or that current to see which factors were most important to El Nino's existence. 

 They built a simple computer model, and almost as an afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then, in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the onset of a string of El Ninos. 

 Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their predecessor. 

 By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to making climate predictions up to a year in advance. 

 Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya. 

 Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in years without a big El Nino. 

 There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of El Nino does change. 

 From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from 1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again, and since the late 1970s they've been very big. 

 The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather with stunning swiftness. 

 Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then stay that way for thousands of years. 

 Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages. 

 Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.
