BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers today expect climatic repercussions on global weather as El Nino is expected to come sometime this year or the next. 

 Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration, issued the warning today at a press conference on this year's marine disaster forecast. 

 The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today. 

 El Nino phenomenon, which comes at an interval of roughly four years, refers to abnormal temperature rises in tropical waters which normally leads to global anomalies in weather and climate. 

 El Nino was blamed for the heavy summer rains in China, causing devastating floods in areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northwest China in 1998.
