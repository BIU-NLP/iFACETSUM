GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) held a first follow-up meeting on El Nino here today after a United Nations inter-agency task force on the phenomenon was set up on Wednesday. 

 The meeting will provide scientific and technical information on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect weather patterns in many areas of the globe. 

 According to WMO, strong warm episode (El Nino) conditions have persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997. Sea surface temperatures throughout the equatorial east-central Pacific increased during April and May, when temperatures normally decrease in this region. 

 During August and September, ocean surface temperatures reached near-record levels in many sections of the equatorial Pacific. Departures from normal exceeded +4 degrees Celsius along the Equator east of 120 degrees West, and were greater than +5 degrees Celsius near the Galapagos Islands and along the coast of northern Peru, WMO says in its new publication, El Nino Update.
