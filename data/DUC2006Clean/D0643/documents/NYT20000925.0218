For many parts of the Americas and Asia, the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in, usually with little warning, then staying for months or sometimes a year or two, bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts, heat and cold. 

 Now, after a record El Nino in 1997 and 1998, followed almost immediately by a prolonged La Nina, the tropical Pacific has shaken off its fever and chills and is expected for at least a year to be ``normal.'' 

 So one might think meteorologists could relax a bit. But it is exactly the opposite, many of them say. Now they are sweating. With no El Nino or La Nina, there is no sheep dog driving the sheep, no strong organizing force giving shape to the otherwise chaotic flow of weather across the seas and continents. 

 As a result, long-term forecasts _ the ones that help determine the price of oil or natural gas futures, the ones that determine how much road salt your town buys this fall _ are looking a bit like guesswork. 

 ``Over the last three years, a lot of people have looked pretty sharp,'' said Dr. William C. Patzert, a research oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ``Now the going gets tough.'' 

 Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina. They have still not found a way to predict when one or the other will develop. 

 For example, the El Nino that formed in 1997 and boosted global temperatures to record highs was unanticipated, as was its intensity. 

 But once one of the conditions settles into place, meteorologists have become adept at predicting the consequences and incorporating those patterns into long-term forecasts. 

 Normally, Patzert said, the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific varies only a few degrees Fahrenheit through the course of a year. An El Nino can raise surface temperatures 14 degrees above normal over an area three times the size of the contiguous United States. A La Nina can drop it nearly 8 degrees. 

 More heat causes more evaporation and more rising hot air, meaning more storms. Cooler temperatures, Patzert said, create the equivalent ``of a stone in a stream,'' nudging storm tracks and the jet stream out of place. 

 El Nino has been linked to strong winter storms that batter southern California, to a weak hurricane season in the Atlantic as high-altitude winds shear the towering tops from developing tropical storms, to searing droughts in southern Asia like the one that spawned enormous rain forest fires in Indonesia in 1997. 

 A La Nina, among other things, seems to nurture Atlantic hurricanes, push the North American winter storm track further north, and bring heat and drought to the West. 

 Without either, weather becomes typical _ meaning largely unpredictable _ meteorologists say. 

 The government's long-term forecast maps for this winter retreat largely to what meteorologists call ``climatology'' _ essentially a tossup _ with most of North America given an even chance of having below average, above average, or average temperatures. Precipitation charts are a little less equivocal, but only a little. 

 To point out just how fuzzy things will be in coming months, Dr. Tim P. Barnett, a marine physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, described government predictions for his home town: ``For San Diego this winter, indicators range from extremely heavy precipitation to very dry, with all categories equally likely.'' 

 He said meteorologists, if they are prudent, will likely include strong caveats in any long-term forecasts in the coming months. 

 ``You just have to say that's the way it is,'' Barnett said. Without anything driving the system, he added, ``the atmosphere tends to be its wonderful chaotic normal self, and that makes forecasting very difficult.'' 

 There are signs that this may not always be the case. Dr. John O. Roads, the director of the experimental climate prediction center at Scripps, said that new work is showing that there are plenty of other subtle influences on long-term weather that should eventually improve predictions, even in years without the strong influence from the Pacific. 

 He said that soil moisture and snow cover appear perceptibly to influence seasonal weather patterns, adding that computer models at Scripps are beginning to incorporate some of these variables with some success. 

 But it will be years before these forces are incorporated in official forecasts issued by federal climate prediction centers, he said. 

 One place where the frontier of forecasting is already being pushed is at private forecasting companies whose predictions are sold to commodities traders, utilities, or other customers whose business relies on anticipating future weather. 

 To prosper, these companies have to offer a product that is better than the government's forecasts. 

 A false move can make or break a trader trying to anticipate the price of winter wheat or heating oil or natural gas, said Drew Lerner, a meteorologist for Bridge Global Weather Services, a private forecasting company in Overland, Kan. 

 He said that he and his competitors have to look at subtler influences on weather, including things like sunspot cycles or soil condition in the Midwest or other less obvious temperature shifts in the Pacific and Atlantic. 

 ``You take all these things and try to put it all together,'' he said. 

 Among his predictions for this winter are a lack of strong storms along the Atlantic coast, colder than normal temperatures in the northern Plains and Great Lakes region, and abundant January precipitation from the lower Middle West to the mid-Atlantic seaboard. 

 But it all would have been a lot easier if the last La Nina had stuck around a few more months, Lerner said.
