WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Weather satellite data that detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by researchers. 

 The study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked the warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased rains in Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals. 

 Researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland State of the United States and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington analyzed 50 years of weather and medical data to establish the connection between warm oceans, rains and the fever. 

 "We discovered a cycle of Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that appeared to depend on rainfall," said Kenneth Linthicum of Walter Reed. "There were large outbreaks every seven to 10 years, but the virus apparently disappears between outbreaks." 

 Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard researcher who uses satellites to study the oceans, said that East Africa gets more rain during an El Nino, but that this effect, alone, is not enough to prompt a fever outbreak. 

 A fever outbreak is more likely to occur when the Indian Ocean warms at the same time as there is an El Nino, a phenomenon that includes the warming of Pacific Ocean waters. 

 "When the western equatorial Indian Ocean is similar to the East Pacific in sea-surface temperature, there will likely be a large-scale outbreak of Rift Valley Fever," said Anyamba. 

 Researchers said their study suggests that satellite data that measures sea surface temperature, along with measurements of vegetation growth in East Africa, could pinpoint areas where Rift Valley Fever outbreaks are most likely to occur. 

 They said that satellite data could give a two-to-five-month warning of a Rift Valley Fever outbreak. This would give time to vaccinate livestock and to treat mosquito habitats with insecticides that are released upon flooding. This would prevent the mosquitoes from hatching and, thus, break the cycle of disease.
