WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a while it seemed as though everything from tornadoes to toadstools and hailstorms to hemlines was being blamed on El Nino. Now, it turns out the periodic weather event produced a lot more good than bad. 

 That's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A. Changnon, who calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 deaths, it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons. 

 And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. 

 ``If you treat it as an economic outcome for the country ... most of the country benefited,'' Changnon said. 

 True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast. 

 But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes. 

 ``I figured, just watching what was happening, that it was going to be a zero-sum game but it turned out far from that,'' Changnon said in a telephone interview from his Mahomet, Ill., home. 

 Michael Glantz, an El Nino expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, was skeptical. 

 ``It's a noble attempt but I wouldn't take the numbers to the bank,'' he said. ``I'm wary of trying to cost out weather events.'' 

 In his paper, Changnon admitted there could be up to a 30 percent variation in the costs and benefits cited, but noted that would still produce considerably more benefit than loss. 

 Jim O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere Prediction Studies at Florida State University, welcomed Changnon's report. 

 ``El Nino is a good dude for the United States,'' O'Brien said in a telephone interview. ``In actuality, La Nina is worse for the United States, there are more hurricanes, there is an increase in tornadoes and they spread over a wider region ... there is drought,'' he said. 

 El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that area and can affect the climate worldwide. La Nina, an abnormal cooling of the Pacific sea surface, is currently taking place. It, too, can affect the world's weather. La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos. 

 According to Changnon, as few as 100 people died in winter cold and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino, well below the average of 850 in recent years. 

 Generally mild temperatures ``greatly reduced lives lost to extreme cold,'' Changnon wrote, and there also were fewer weather-related auto accidents and deaths in winter storms. 

 ``El Nino's influence on the atmosphere led to the elimination of major Atlantic hurricanes during 1997,'' he added. That meant no lives lost compared to the average of 20 in recent years and it meant an enormous savings for home and business owners, governments and insurers. 

 The mild temperatures also saved businesses and homeowners millions of dollars they didn't have to spend on heating fuel, Changnon said, though that also can be calculated as a loss for utilities. 

 Lack of demand for heating fuel made oil a glut on the market, resulting in the price of gasoline dropping to as low as 80 cents a gallon in some parts of the country, O'Brien pointed out. 

 In addition to the economic benefits of the mild winter, Changnon reported, ``Thousands went out of doors more, millions went shopping, many altered their types of recreation, and almost everyone enjoyed better health than in normal winters.'' 

 Glantz raised the ``question of what is a normal year, which no one has defined. No one has calculated to the U.S. the cost of weather in a normal year. Extremes are going on every year,'' he commented. 

 ``It's admirable that he tried to put numbers on this stuff,'' Glantz concluded, but ``it's very hard to attribute weather events.''
