WASHINGTON _ Thomas Penfield Jackson seems a natural as a judge. He's a big man, white haired, avuncular. But he did not seem a clear natural for the Microsoft trial. 

 Jackson is hardly a technophile; he has been known to write opinions longhand. And while the fast moving world of technology demanded an equally fast-paced trial, Jackson got in trouble once for allowing a trial to go on too long _ so long, in fact, that the Court of Appeals ordered him to rule. 

 But lawyers said he administered the Microsoft trial brilliantly. It was by far the most prominent, and probably the most important trial of his career. And he got through it winning plaudits from both sides for the innovative procedures that allowed testimony to be completed in less than a year, when most major antitrust trials have typically run on for nearly a decade. What is more, as the trial proceeded, his knowledge of the computer industry grew; he asked more and more technical questions that demonstrated an ever firmer grasp. 

 Jackson once told a group of reporters who happened to share a cab with him toward the end of the trial that he tried hard to sit Sphinx-like on the bench, so no one could read anything into his expressions. But at that one thing, at least, he failed. 

 Anyone watching could see when he was bored, when he was captivated by the testimony, when he was angry and when he was amused. Some judges put on expressions deliberately, to manipulate the audience. But Jackson seemed guileless. 

 While he cautioned that no one should read anything into his questions, comments, smirks and shrugs, the tenor of his behavior usually left little doubt that Microsoft was not winning the day, or the trial. 

 His findings of fact bore that out. And given his history, it is clear that he prepared them with attention and care. The Court of Appeals rebuked him last year by overturning a previous ruling in a related Microsoft case. That was hardly the judge's only reproval from the higher court. 

 But his findings of fact are almost bulletproof by their very nature. Appeals courts essentially have no standing to question his judgments about the credibility of the testimony before him. And if, as expected, the conclusions of law and verdict hew closely to these findings of fact, the judge's eventual ruling is more likely to withstand appeals. 

 Thomas Penfield Jackson was born in 1937 and grew up in Kensington, Md., a pleasant, leafy, middle-class suburb of Washington with Victorian homes and its own sense of community. His father, Thomas Searing Jackson, was a prominent Washington lawyer who started his own firm, Jackson & Campbell.

 Jackson attended St. Albans prep school in the early grades, on a choir scholarship. But when his voice changed, St. Albans yanked the scholarship and demanded full tuition. So Jackson was transferred to a first-class public high school in Montgomery County, Md. There he played football and was editor of the school newspaper. He has said he once toyed with becoming a journalist. 

 Jackson spent his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, creating a lifelong affiliation with the school. In fact, for several years he headed Dartmouth's alumni association in Washington. After graduation, he spent three years in the Navy, most of it aboard a destroyer in the Mediterranean, and then attended Harvard Law School. 

 Soon after, he joined his father's firm as a civil and criminal litigator. Among other cases, he defended several medical organizations charged with malpractice and was often described as a tenacious litigator. 

 Along the way, he became politically active in Montgomery County, an area so heavily Democratic that Republicans like Jackson were ciphers. But the flip side was that it was easy for Republicans to stand out and be noticed, as Jackson was. He came to the attention of the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, which he served as a lawyer in 1972 _ and avoided any taint from Watergate. 

 In 1980, his name was mentioned for a possible appointment to the District of Columbia Superior Court or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But he was not chosen, and some lawyers at the time said he was not selected because of his membership in the Chevy Chase Country Club, which accepted no black members. 

 Whether or not that was the reason, his membership was probably viewed as impolitic for a judge presiding over trials of District residents, most of whom were black. But that rejection turned out to be a blessing. 

 The Reagan White House clearly did not care about the club membership. And two years later, in 1982, President Reagan appointed him to a better position, on the U.S. District Court. Like every judge in that courthouse, he has presided over his share of interesting and important cases, including the 1988 trial of Michael K. Deaver, the former top Reagan aide who was convicted of lying under oath during an investigation of whether he had improperly lobbied former White House associates. 

 But his most prominent case, before Microsoft, was the trial of the mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, on drug and perjury charges. As in the Microsoft trial, he often interrupted the lawyers to ask witnesses questions of his own. 

 Rasheeda Moore, the former model who was used to lure Barry to a hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack, referred several times on the tape to ``Jell-O.'' 

 Spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for drugs, but neither the prosecution nor the defense thought to ask. So Jackson spoke up to ask: Was Jell-O a secret word for drugs? ``No, unh-unh,'' Ms. Moore replied; she was merely talking about dessert. 

 Jackson may not have believed that. In fact he had trouble with the trial. Shortly after it ended, he complained in a speech to the Harvard Law Forum that he thought ``four jurors were determined to acquit regardless of the facts,'' adding that ``they obviously did not tell the truth during jury selection when questioned about possible bias.'' Jackson went on to say that the government had put on a very strong case. 

 In 1995, the local paper Legal Times sent a reporter to spend a day in his courtroom, to check stories floating around that he was slow-moving. The reporter wrote that he took a two-hour lunch and three ``10-minute'' breaks that each lasted half an hour. All in all, the judge had spent 3 hours and 4 minutes on the bench, the reporter wrote, while his breaks lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes. 

 During the Microsoft trial, the judge scheduled a 90-minute lunch break every day that usually lasted about 110 minutes. And he had regular breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon, each of which lasted about 20 minutes. Trial opened at 10 a.m. and generally adjourned for the day about 4:20, though sometimes it went as late as 5 p.m. 

 So, generally, Jackson spent about four hours on the bench, three hours on breaks. And given the highly technical nature of the testimony, that was probably as much as he or anyone else could handle. No one complained.

 While on the bench, he gave the lawyers for both sides great leeway to conduct their examinations as they chose, usually overruling objections and only occasionally prodding the lawyers to hurry up when he thought the examinations were plodding along in a way that was of little use to him. This was appropriate since he was hearing the case without a jury. 

 In his spare time, Jackson sails on the Chesapeake Bay and reads, both fiction and nonfiction. He has been married three times and has two grown daughters and two granddaughters. His wife, Pat, is director of development at Sidwell Friends, a prep school in Washington. 

 The Microsoft trial, of course, gave the judge more exposure, more attention in the press, than he had ever had before. He plainly was not comfortable with that. In 1997 he wrote a commentary for a judicial conference that showed his view of the news media. 

 ``The relationship between a potentially newsworthy case and the press is roughly comparable to the relationship between a healthy organism and an infectious disease,'' he wrote, adding: ``The press, like all infectious diseases, is a predator. It will feed on whatever it can find, including the host if its appetite is not sated.''
