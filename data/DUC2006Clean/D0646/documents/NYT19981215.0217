WASHINGTON _ The first two impeachment articles that the House will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. But he has declared repeatedly that while his sworn testimony regarding the former White House intern was misleading, it was not perjury. Following is a primer on the issue: 

 WHAT IS PERJURY? 

 Black's Law Dictionary defines perjury as ``a false statement knowingly made'' in a court proceeding about ``some matter material to the issue or point in question.'' 

 In addition to perjury, federal law also prohibits making false statements on federal forms or to federal officers such as FBI agents. Unlike perjury, this crime may be committed without a sworn oath. Under federal law, perjury and false statements are punishable by an undetermined fine, up to five years in prison or both. 

 ARE PERJURY PROSECUTIONS COMMON? 

 Out of 49,655 prosecutions in federal courts in 1997, 87 were for perjury. In state courts such prosecutions are more common. California, for instance, had 4,318 perjury cases among 326,768 felony prosecutions last year. 

 WHAT DOES THE SUPREME COURT SAY ABOUT PERJURY? 

 The court ruled in 1973 that while witnesses under oath must tell the truth, they are not required to fill in the blanks. They may answer questions narrowly as long as the answers are truthful. In that case, Samuel Bronston, a movie producer whose company went bankrupt, had been convicted of perjury for giving misleading, though technically truthful, answers about his Swiss bank account. The Supreme Court overturned his conviction. 

 WHAT IS THE PERJURY CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT CLINTON? 

 The specific allegations contained in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress refer to: 

 _ Clinton's denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit that he ever had a ``sexual affair,'' a ``sexual relationship'' or ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky. ``Sexual relations'' were defined as ``when (a) person knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ...'' 

 _ Clinton's insistence in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony that his Jan. 17 answer narrowly fit the definition of ``sexual relations'' presented to him. During the Aug. 17 testimony, Clinton acknowledged having ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky. 

 _ Clinton's vague recollections in his Jan. 17 deposition on whether he had ever been alone with Lewinsky and his statements minimizing the number of gifts the two exchanged. Starr's report cited 10 sexual encounters in the White House and the exchange of about 50 gifts. 

 _ Clinton's failure to be specific in his deposition when asked about his conversations with Lewinsky around the time she was called to be a witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against him. In the Starr report, Lewinsky testified that she and Clinton discussed her involvement in the Jones case in detail at least four times. In a 2 a.m. phone call from Clinton Dec. 17, 1997, he allegedly told her, ``You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty (Currie, Clinton's secretary) or that you were bringing me letters.'' 

 _ Clinton's failure to recall whether his close friend, Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, had ever talked to Lewinsky about her involvement in the Jones case. Jordan, who in late 1997 tried to find Lewinsky a job in New York, told the grand jury he kept Clinton fully informed of all his efforts on Lewinsky's behalf, including finding her a lawyer after she was subpoenaed in the Jones case on Dec. 19, 1997. On Jan. 7, Jordan told Clinton that Lewinsky had signed an affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the president. 

 WHAT IS THE REPUBLICANS' ARGUMENT ON THE PERJURY CHARGES? 

 They say Clinton perjured himself by playing word games with the definition of ``sexual relations.'' The definition was broad enough to include oral sex, and Clinton's denial that he touched or stimulated Lewinsky was contradicted by Lewinsky. Second, his vague recollections on being alone with Lewinsky, exchanging gifts and other matters amounted to perjury because he knew when he testified in the Jones deposition that he and Lewinsky had been alone repeatedly, that they had exchanged numerous gifts and that he had several conversations with her and Vernon Jordan over her's role in the Jones case. House Judiciary Committee Republicans used Clinton's more forthcoming Aug. 17 grand jury testimony to point up discrepancies in the Jan. 17 deposition. For instance, Clinton said in the deposition, ``I'm not sure'' when asked whether he talked to Lewinsky about her testifying in the Jones case. But in his grand jury testimony, he admitted he spoke to Lewinsky about it when she visited him at the White House on Dec. 28, 1997. In his deposition, Clinton said he had ``no specific recollection'' of being alone with Lewinsky. But in his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged being alone with Lewinsky on repeated occasions. 

 WHAT IS CLINTON'S DEFENSE? 

 Clinton's defenders say he did not lie under oath but that even if he did, untruths uttered to hide an extramarital sexual affair do not rise to the level of offenses so severe that impeachment is warranted. Clinton has said he believed ``sexual relations'' referred to sexual intercourse, and not oral sex. His lawyers cite five dictionary definitions to back him up. ``This interpretation may be confusing to some,'' Clinton's lawyers said in a 184-page legal defense submitted to the Judiciary Committee. ``It may be counterintuitive. It may lead to bizarre answers. But it certainly was not objectively wrong.'' 

 The White House also contends that Starr and House Republicans have mischaracterized Clinton's testimony on subjects such as his being alone with Lewinsky. Clinton answered ``yes'' when asked whether it was possible he was alone with Lewinsky. On gift giving, Clinton invited the Jones lawyers to list specific gifts so he could confirm or deny any exchanges. After the lawyers named a few, Clinton recalled giving Lewinsky something from the Black Dog, a restaurant on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. On the question of whether he discussed Lewinsky's possible testimony in the Jones case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, White House lawyers argue that Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest perjury by Clinton. For instance, the Starr report says Clinton answered, ``I don't think so'' when asked whether anyone besides his lawyers told him that Lewinsky had been subpoenaed in the Jones case. The report, White House lawyers argue, leaves out Clinton's next answer that Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey first told him. 

 White House counsel Charles Ruff acknowledged to Judidicary members that in the Jones deposition, Clinton ``walked up to the line'' of perjury, and ``reasonable people ... could determine that he crossed that line.'' But Ruff added that the president was convinced he was telling the truth. 

 CAN CLINTON EVER BE PROSECUTED FOR PERJURY? 

 The Constitution says that impeachment and removal from office are no bar to criminal prosecution afterward. However, a White House-selected panel of former prosecutors and legal scholars told the Judiciary Committee last week that the case for perjury against Clinton was too weak to bring before a jury.
