WASHINGTON _ It is not the finger-wagging speech. It is not the infamous declaration that ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman.'' It is not the adultery or even the lies to the American people. None of these individual acts, even many of President Clinton's harshest critics say, are impeachable offenses. 

 Instead, the case for impeachment is a winding legal staircase, which must be understood step by step, according to those who believe that Clinton's actions must lead to his removal from office. 

 The heart of the case against the president is the allegation that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he said his testimony in an earlier civil case was truthful. Moreover, Clinton tried to obstruct justice and hide his relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky, according to the impeachment articles approved last month by the House. 

 To those who believe Clinton should be ousted, the evidence is so overwhelming they can't understand why the public backs Clinton or why the Senate seems likely to acquit him. 

 ``The evidence is very clear,'' said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the 13 House ``managers'' slated to present the case against Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial. ``He committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, and it is very clear these are impeachable offenses. It is an incredible thought that we would let the president remain in office if the senators came to the same conclusion that I have.'' 

 McCollum, like several other House managers, said he views the upcoming trial as a last chance to convince the public that the case against Clinton has nothing to do with partisanship, but instead is based on irrefutable evidence and the mandates of the Constitution. 

 What follows is an attempt to explain the case against Clinton, according to interviews with House managers and based on the array of evidence from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and the House Judiciary Committee. The case revolves around two impeachment articles approved Dec. 19 by the House, finding that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury and obstructed justice. 

 --Perjury. While the House rejected an impeachment article that said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it approved an article that said Clinton lied about many of the same facts before the federal grand jury. This has complicated matters for the House managers because in order to prove that Clinton lied before the grand jury, it must be established that Clinton lied in the civil case. 

 ``The burden of proof is higher,'' said Representative James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a House manager who is slated to deliver the opening statement in the Senate trial Thursday. ``We have to prove he lied twice.'' But Sensenbrenner said it is clear the lie occurred in both cases. 

 The lie, according to the Starr report and the House Judiciary Committee, is that Clinton repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in the civil case. Or, as the impeachment article puts it, Clinton made ``prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a Federal civil rights action brought against him.'' 

 Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex. However, impeachment backers said even if that is true, Clinton made other false statements during his testimony. For example, Clinton denied touching private parts of Lewinsky's body, which Lewinsky testified did occur. 

 That has led Democratic critics such as Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts to say that the case against Clinton is based on where he touched Lewinsky. But Sensenbrenner said such complaints are ludicrous, arguing there is ample proof that Clinton and Lewinsky agreed to cover up their relationship. 

 Significantly, the Republican counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, David Schippers, has said Clinton and Lewinsky were alone on at least 21 occasions. 

 ``They had at least 11 personal sexual encounters, excluding phone sex _ three in 1995, five in 1996 and at least three in 1997,'' Schippers said. ``They had at least 55 telephone conversations, some of which, at least 17, involved phone sex. The president gave Ms. Lewinsky 24 presents, and Ms. Lewinsky gave the president 40 presents.'' 

 Yet Clinton gave a very different explanation under oath for a deposition in the Jones case: 

 ``Q. At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky alone together in the Oval Office?'' 

 ``A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends. She _ it seems to me she brought things to me once or twice on the weekends.'' 

 At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.'' 

 When Clinton was asked to explain these answers in his grand jury testimony, he blamed the Jones attorneys for failing to ask precise questions. He explained that his answers were based partly on the tense of the questions. Clinton said, ``In the language I used, I said, there's nothing going on between us. That was true. I said I did not have sex with her as I defined it. That was true.'' Asked why he denied being alone with Lewinsky, Clinton explained, ``there were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never really thought we were.'' 

 To this day, Clinton has not explicitly acknowledged having an affair or sexual relations with Lewinsky. During his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged having an inappropriate relationship with her, and he has said publicly that he has sinned. But he has not said that he lied in the civil case or before the grand jury. 

 The House prosecutors, however, argue that Clinton's lies are self-evident and occurred under oath. 

 Still, some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense. Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat, has said he might be able to vote for acquittal of the president even if he is convinced that Clinton committed perjury. 

 To Sensenbrenner and other House managers, such reasoning makes no sense. Sensenbrenner noted that the Constitution says a president should be impeached for ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Under the federal criminal code, Sensenbrenner said, ``the penalty for perjury is higher than for bribery.'' As a result, he said, perjury falls into the category of other high crimes. Thus, Sensenbrenner said, Clinton must convicted. 

 --Obstruction of justice. The second article of impeachment says Clinton conspired with others to ``impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony'' in the Jones case. The article gives seven examples, including the president's effort to get Lewinsky to sign a sworn affidavit denying that they had a sexual relationship. 

 The article also says Clinton tried to keep Lewinsky quiet by trying to get her a job and by lying himself in the Jones case. 

 Clinton's chief defense is to quote the following testimony from Lewinsky: ``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.'' 

 But whenever the White House quotes this line, it neglects to supply the rest of the testimony, in which Lewinsky said: ``The best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either.'' 

 It is the discrepancy between these two quotes from Lewinsky that has led the House managers to conclude that her testimony before the Senate is crucial. The president's fate could turn on whether she had an ``understanding'' with Clinton to lie about their relationship, as impeachment backers have charged. 

 McCollum said it is incorrect to assume that Clinton can escape conviction in the Senate. If the House managers are able to present their case, with witnesses in an open session of the Senate, then many skeptical Democratic senators might be swayed to vote for conviction, McCollum said. 

 ``I think if we make a compelling case, it is likely there will be surprises,'' McCollum said. ``I wouldn't predict it will end in acquittal.''
