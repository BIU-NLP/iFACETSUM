MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) -- A man who was cleared of murdering a woman more than a decade ago but later confessed to the killing was convicted of perjury Friday and sentenced to six years in prison. 

 William Dunlop, 36, had always denied killing Julie Hogg in a frenzied sexual attack at her Billingham home in 1989. The jury in his first trial failed to reach a verdict, and a formal verdict of not guilty was returned after a second panel also could not come to a decision. 

 Police and Hogg's family always believed Dunlop was guilty, but he could never again be tried for her death. 

 Earlier this year, while serving a seven-year sentence for a serious assault on another woman, Dunlop told a prison officer he had killed Hogg. 

 He then was charged with two counts of perjury for giving false evidence under oath at his two trials. 

 In a statement after the sentencing at Teesside Crown Court in Middlesbrough, northeast England, the Crown Prosecution Service described the case as ''highly unusual.''
