ATLANTA _ When Judge Gerald Tjoflat testifies today before the House Judiciary Committee about the consequences of lying under oath, he will probably speak his mind and mince few words. 

 Tjoflat, a Jacksonville judge who sits on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has a reputation for being a no-nonsense jurist. And his strongly worded ruling upholding a 1994 perjury conviction is nothing that ardent supporters of President Clinton want to hear about. 

 ``We categorically reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise, that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a civil proceeding,'' Tjoflat wrote. ``Perjury, regardless of the setting, is a serious offense that results in incalculable harm to the functioning and integrity of the legal system as well as to private individuals.'' 

 Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks said that with regard to perjured testimony there is no gray area for Tjoflat, who has sat on the federal bench for 28 years. 

 ``In the typical straightforward and blunt way that he's famous for, I'm sure he'll tell the committee that perjury is perjury is perjury,'' Parks said. ``If you come in my court and you lie, you infect the system and mess it up.'' 

 Buddy Parker, a former federal prosecutor who has argued numerous cases before Tjoflat, predicted, ``With his commanding presence and voice, he's the kind of guy who'll go up to Capitol Hill and take no prisoners.'' 

 Tjoflat is among six witnesses called by the committee Republicans to testify in what may be the final hearing before the panel votes on articles of impeachment against Clinton. Tjoflat will be joined by Judge Charles Wiggins, a former Republican congressman and a member of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco; two military officers; and two convicted perjurers, including former University of South Carolina basketball coach and Atlanta resident Pam Parsons. 

 Democrats have summoned five witnesses, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Elliot Richardson, who in 1973 resigned as attorney general rather than carry out President Nixon's order to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 

 Tjoflat likely is being called to testify because he authored one of the nation's strongest appellate opinions against perjury. The 1994 ruling upheld the conviction of Ku Klux Klan grand dragon David Wayne Holland of Lawrenceville, Ga. 

 Holland and 10 other white supremacists had been sued in federal court in Atlanta after they attacked civil rights marchers during a 1987 demonstration in Forsyth County, Ga. A federal jury assessed a $450,000 judgment against Holland. He was later convicted of lying under oath when asked whether he tried to hide his assets to prevent the marchers from collecting on the judgment. 

 At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans believed the federal sentencing guidelines called for Holland to receive lenient treatment because he committed perjury in a civil _ and not a criminal _ proceeding. But prosecutors appealed that interpretation. 

 In his ruling that directed Evans to re-sentence Holland without leniency with regard to the perjured testimony, Tjoflat noted that Holland ``wilfully made material statements under oath that he knew were false. . . . His actions needlessly consumed court time, forced the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office to engage in prolonged investigations and attempted to prevent private citizens from satisfying their judgment.'' 

 Michael Hauptman, Holland's lawyer, said he believes Evans correctly followed the sentencing guidelines. He also noted that Tjoflat summarily rejected his challenge that Holland's conviction be dismissed on claims of selective prosecution. 

 Gerald Bard Tjoflat, who turns 69 on Sunday, was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. During the Korean War, he served as a special agent for the counterintelligence corps and, over the years, he has been actively involved in the Boy Scouts. 

 A former chief judge of the 11-member appeals court in Atlanta, Tjoflat is considered a moderate conservative. 

 Tjoflat has testified previously before Congress, urging lawmakers not to increase the number of judges on his court even though appeals continue to skyrocket. More judges make confusing law for the circuit and detract from the collegiality that's needed to make the court function properly and smoothly, he said. As a result, the 11th Circuit, which hears federal appeals out of Alabama, Florida and Georgia, remains one of the nation's busiest appeals courts in terms of cases decided per judge. 

 Robust and full of energy, Tjoflat can bark like a marine sergeant and is often seen with a haggard-looking law clerk at his heels. He revels in telling a story or engaging in an argument, often pausing to ask his audience, ``Do you follow?'' He can dominate oral arguments before the court by peppering lawyers with questions in an aggressive style. 

 ``He speaks his mind and has strong opinions,'' said Gary Myers, a University of Mississippi law professor and former clerk for Tjoflat's. ``He's very, very thorough. He's very good at looking at the record and getting to the facts and to the details of the case. That means he'll be a very well prepared witness before the House Judiciary Committee.'' 

 Lloyd Cohen, another former law clerk and now a George Mason University law professor, said Tjoflat's ethics are beyond reproach. The judge also has too much energy to take senior status, to which he's entitled, Cohen said, recalling how Tjoflat could be a stern taskmaster. 

 Cohen glumly recalls writing one draft after another for a ruling in a major death-penalty case. Tjoflat sent them all back, unsatisfied with each draft. 

 ``We finally came in to work on it one Saturday and he sat at his desk and wrote the whole thing in long hand,'' Cohen said. ``My job was to pass him sharpened pencils. It was not my most ego-lifting experience, but it was a fine opinion.''
