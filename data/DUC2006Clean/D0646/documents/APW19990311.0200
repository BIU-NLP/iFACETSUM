LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former Mouseketeer has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for using phony or bounced checks to buy investments and lying about it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Darlene Fraschilla, who changed her last name from Gillespie after her January marriage, showed no emotion at Thursday's sentencing. She also must pay $6,144 in restitution and serve three years of supervised release. 

 She must report to prison by July 26. Mrs. Fraschilla, who was one of the nine original Mouseketeers on the Mickey Mouse Club television show from 1955-1959, had faced up to 90 years in prison. 

 Mrs. Fraschilla said she plans to appeal. 

 Jurors convicted her in December on a dozen counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, obstruction of justice and perjury. 

 Prosecutors said she helped her then-boyfriend, Jerry Fraschilla, in a scheme to buy more than 194,000 shares of stock valued at $827,000 in 1992 and 1993 by writing checks on closed and overdrawn accounts. 

 Fraschilla, 61, pleaded guilty to 21 counts of fraud last year and was sentenced to 18 months in prison and probation. He also was ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution.
