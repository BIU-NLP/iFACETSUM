NEW YORK (AP) -- A policeman was convicted Wednesday of lying to investigators to avoid becoming a ''rat'' in the case against patrolmen who tortured a prisoner in a precinct house's bathroom. 

 The jury deliberated two days in Brooklyn federal court before delivering a split verdict, finding Francisco Rosario guilty of two counts of conspiring with his partner to make false statements to the FBI six weeks after the 1997 assault of Abner Louima. He was acquitted of a third count that charged he lied again in a later interrogation. 

 Rosario became the sixth officer to either be convicted at trial or plead guilty in one of the worst brutality scandals in city history. The 1997 attack on Louima, a black Haitian immigrant, sparked protests and prompted a Justice Department investigation into whether the New York Police Department fosters abuse of minorities by not cracking down on excessive force. 

 Prosecutors had accused Rosario of lying because he ''did not want to be labeled a rat.'' 

 Defense attorney Richard Levitt said Rosario would appeal. 

 Rosario faces up to five years in prison; no sentencing date was set.
