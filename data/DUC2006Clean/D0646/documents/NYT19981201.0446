WASHINGTON _ Even President Clinton concedes that he did not tell the truth about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But did he commit perjury under the definition of the law? 

 The vote in the House of Representatives over whether to impeach Clinton could turn on how this question is answered. The consensus of Republicans in Congress is that he clearly perjured himself, and many say it is the charge on which they are most confident they can muster a majority for impeachment. 

 ``That is where the evidence is most compelling,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a member of the House Judiciary Committee. ``That will be the major focus'' of articles of impeachment, Canady added. 

 Many Democrats say that even if the president did lie under oath about a sexual relationship, it is insufficient grounds for impeachment. At Tuesday's committee hearing, some offered a new line of defense, saying Republicans had failed to prove that Clinton had perjured himself. 

 Republicans had called the hearing to emphasize that perjury is an important crime. The federal perjury laws require prosecutors to prove that offenders ``knowingly'' lied under oath and that the lies were ``material'' to the cases in which the false testimony was given. 

 Lawyers for Clinton and some Democrats at Tuesday's hearing maintain that he did not commit perjury because his sworn statements, however misleading, were literally true on all important matters. They said that either he believed his denials to be true, testified that he could not recall something or had recollections at odds with other witnesses. At worst, they said, this would be misleading, but not deliberately false. 

 In his public address on Aug. 17, Clinton conceded that he did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was inappropriate and wrong and that his statements about it had been misleading. But the president also said his answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones case last January, when he denied having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, were ``legally accurate.'' 

 The Supreme Court has held that intentionally misleading statements do not amount to perjury. In a 1973 case (Bronston vs. United States), the court ruled that perjury had not occurred when this testimony was given under oath by a witness who maintained a Swiss bank account for five years but closed it: 

 Q. Do you have any bank accounts in Switzerland? 

 A. No, sir. 

 Q. Have you ever? 

 A. The company had an account there for about six months. 

 Republicans working on drafting articles of impeachment say say they are generally following the lines established by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In his report to Congress, Starr cited these five instances when, he maintained, the president had lied under oath: 

 1. In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied he had engaged in a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 

 2. He made similar denials to the federal grand jury. 

 3. In the civil deposition, he said he could not remember being alone in the White House with Ms. Lewinsky or giving her presents. 

 4. In the deposition, he said he had not had a detailed conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about her testimony in the Jones lawsuit. 

 5. In the deposition, he said he did not remember whether his friend Vernon Jordan Jr. had talked with Ms. Lewinsky about the Jones case. 

 Clinton's critics agree that the strongest cases can be made in the first three. The facts in these cases are not in dispute, only the interpretation. Here are the details: 

 1. When the president gave his deposition in the Jones case on Jan. 17, this definition of ``sexual relations'' was agreed on: ``A person engages in `sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ... `Contact' means intentional touching, either directly or through clothing.'' 

 Clinton was asked: ``Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined?'' 

 He replied: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 

 Ms. Lewinsky told the federal grand jury about 10 encounters she had with Clinton that involved intimate contact but not intercourse. In his grand jury testimony, he took the view that his statement in the deposition had been accurate because sexual relations occurred only with sexual intercourse. As for oral sex, he said, ``If the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is ... not with anything on that list but with the lips of another person.'' 

 2. When Clinton went before the grand jury on Aug. 17, prosecutors bore in on the question of whether he had touched Ms. Lewinsky in the designated areas. 

 This was one exchange: 

 Q. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval Office area you touched her breasts, would she be lying? 

 A. That is not my recollection. My recollection is that I did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 

 After some back-and-forth, the questioning continued, as follows: 

 Q. So touching in your view then and now _ the person being deposed touching or kissing the breast of another person would fall within the definition? 

 A. That's correct, sir. 

 And moments later, there was this exchange: 

 A. You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined. 

 Q. Including touching her breast, kissing her breast, touching her genitalia? 

 A. That's correct.
