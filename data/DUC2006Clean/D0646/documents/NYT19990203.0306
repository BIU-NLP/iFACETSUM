LONDON _ The distance between grace and disgrace is nowhere greater than in Britain, where every rent in the shredding of a reputation can be measured by a lost title, a black-balled club membership, a fur-fringed ceremonial robe consigned permanently to a hanger. 

 One of the people who enjoyed in abundance the favors with which the British establishment has traditionally rewarded things like good family background, Oxbridge education and the stylish exercise of ambition was Jonathan Aitken. 

 Born into a family of wealth and privilege and with angular good looks to advertise it, Aitken, 56, was a member of Parliament, a minister in the last Conservative Cabinet, a privy counselor to the queen, a rake with enough glamorous conquests to earn him the tabloid title ``Casanova of the Commons'' and a leader of wit and intelligence that made him a rumored contender for future prime minister. 

 Today his likely future is in prison. Gone are his marriage, his fortune, his seaside estate in Kent, his seat in Parliament, his claim on the honorific Right Honorable and, most important, he says, his good name. He is $3.5 million in debt and will have to sell the 10-bedroom Georgian town house where he once posed for soigne family portraits with his wife, son and twin daughters for glossy celebrity magazines. 

 His diplomatic passport has been confiscated, his remaining assets have been frozen, and his gentleman's club, the Beefsteak, says his case has prompted it to ponder the rare act of evicting a member. 

 He pleaded guilty Jan. 19 to perjury and intending to pervert the course of justice for having drafted false testimony for his teen-age daughter to give in court in his behalf. Afterward he contemplated his ruination and the near certainty of jail at his sentencing in June. 

 In a reference befitting his breed, he said: ``As far as the physical miseries go, I am sure I will cope. I lived at Eton in the 1950s, and I know all about life in uncomfortable quarters.'' 

 Bad behavior in British cabinets is not an unusual thing. Twelve ministers from John Major's government had to resign because of financial or sexual transgressions, and four of Tony Blair's principals have had to step down in the last three months. But a collapse of Aitken's dimensions has not been seen since John Profumo, the war minister in Harold Macmillan's government, was caught lying to the House of Commons in 1963 and had to quit. 

 The press typically chronicles these falls from grace with giddy delectation, and in one of the many instances where Aitken's own hubris got the best of him, he virtually made sure that none of the many episodes would end up getting as much attention as his. 

 Accused by The Guardian and a Granada TV documentary in 1995 of accepting money from Arab arms dealers while he was Major's defense procurement minister, Aitken threw down a now-infamous challenge to the press. It is a moment that has been replayed on television here in recent months as frequently as President Clinton's finger-wagging denial of sex with Monica Lewinsky has run in the United States. 

 Portraying himself as a reluctant crusader burdened by destiny, Aitken said, ``If it falls to me to start a fight to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of justice, and the trusty shield of British fair play, so be it.'' 

 He brought a $3 million libel suit in the High Court, and his polished performance on the witness stand was so convincing that the newspaper and the documentary makers offered to settle out of court. Aitken turned down the peace bid, saying it would compromise his honor to meet with his tormentors, and he let the trial proceed. 

 It was then that the newspaper uncovered airline and car rental records that proved that Aitken was lying when he said his bill at the Hotel Ritz in a 1993 visit to Paris was paid by his wife rather than by a Saudi contact as The Guardian alleged. The documents showed that she had in fact been in Geneva. 

 Aitken withdrew his libel suit. His daughter Victoria, 17, was subsequently arrested for having submitted false written testimony, though prosecutors did not pursue her once it was clear that her father had drafted the document and made her sign it. He was charged with perjury, and his wife, Lolicia, said she was ending the marriage. 

 His past caught up with him again in early January when DNA tests revealed that he was the father of the 18-year-old daughter of Soraya Khashoggi, the former wife of Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. 

 Many commentators have had to mine Shakespeare, Greek tragedies and countryside morality tales to come up with parallels for what the life of Jonathan Aitken promised and what it produced. 

 His great-uncle was the newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, his grandfather Lord Rugby, a distinguished colonial civil servant, and his father, Sir William Traven Aitken, a Member of Parliament. After Eton, he studied at Christ Church, Oxford, and during his summer vacations he worked as a speechwriter for Selwyn Lloyd, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillan's government. 

 In the early 1970s he developed contacts in the Arab world, created a financial services group and made his fortune. In 1974 he entered Parliament and drew favorable attention with his right-wing views that were coming into favor in the Conservative Party. 

 But party leader Margaret Thatcher refused to move him onto the front benches. Among his high-profile romances was one with her daughter, Carol, and when he abruptly ended the relationship, Mrs. Thatcher reportedly told an associate that she would never promote a man who ``made Carol cry.'' 

 She also had cause to resent him because of a brash answer he had given an interviewer inquiring about her views of the Middle East. ``I wouldn't say she is open-minded on the Middle East so much as empty-headed,'' Aitken said in a widely quoted response. ``She probably thinks Sinai is the plural of Sinus.'' 

 In 1979 Aitken married a Swiss economist named Lolicia Azucki, but his publicized affairs continued, including one with a prostitute who later gave detailed accounts of his taste for whips and canes. He finally made it into the government under Major, becoming the government's arms purchaser, and then Treasury secretary. He resigned in 1995 to fight his libel case. 

 Aitken today claims religious conversion and speaks of his past with unaccustomed contrition. ``Sometimes you become a prisoner of your own lie,'' he told The Express the day after his plea. ``Ultimately, I have no excuses.''
