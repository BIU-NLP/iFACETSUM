NEW YORK (AP) -- Syracuse businessman Patrick Bennett was convicted Thursday of charges that he orchestrated a huge pyramid scheme and was immediately sent to prison by a judge who said he had proven he ``has absolutely no respect for any law of any kind.'' 

 Prosecutors had accused Bennett of cheating more than 22,000 investors out of $700 million in a case spanning two trials in Manhattan. 

 The first jury to hear the case convicted Bennett of perjury and obstructing a federal investigation of his company but could not reach a verdict on the rest of the charges. 

 ``He committed gross fraud. He committed perjury in every stage of the proceeding. ... Clearly this trial has showed that Patrick R. Bennett is a total amoral individual who engaged in any criminal conduct that benefits him in any way,'' U.S. District Judge John S. Martin Jr. said. 

 The comments came after a jury found Bennett, 46, of Vernon, N.Y., guilty of 42 counts, including securities fraud and money laundering. The jury did not reach a verdict on 11 counts, including the most serious charge of conspiracy. 

 Still, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Smith said Bennett faces at least 20 years in prison, in part because he had been convicted of laundering at least $1 billion. 

 Meanwhile, Smith said, Bennett continued to live lavishly on a 100-acre horse farm in his wife's name. 

 ``The lawns are freshly mowed, there are horses galloping in the pasture, and you have to really ask where did that money come from,'' Smith said. 

 After Thursday's convictions, bail was revoked and Bennett was ordered taken into custody pending sentencing Sept. 13. He stood in court along with his wife, both of them sobbing. 

 Prosecutors had accused Bennett of using Bennett Funding Group to entice investors in 46 states into investing in leases for office equipment that sometimes did not exist. 

 Bennett then pocketed more than $13 million for himself, buying Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse, prosecutors said. They alleged he also spent lavishly, including $19 million for a gambling barge. 

 Bennett had admitted that he lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission after the watchdog agency began investigating the company in 1993. 

 The lies, prosecutors said, stalled the SEC until March 1996, causing investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 

 ``Today's verdict shows that Patrick R. Bennett conducted perhaps the largest financial fraud in United States history,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement. ``This scheme was particularly egregious because it victimized thousands of investors who believed the investments were among the most secure available in our securities markets.''
