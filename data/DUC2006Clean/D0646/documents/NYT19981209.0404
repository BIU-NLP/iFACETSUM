WASHINGTON _ It seems like a tantalizing deal for the White House. Some potential swing-vote Republicans say that if President Clinton would admit he committed perjury when he said he had no sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they would vote against impeachment. 

 ``For the sake of the nation, I ask you to come forward, admit that you lied under oath and indicate that you are prepared to face the consequences of your actions,'' Representative Bob Franks, a New Jersey Republican, wrote Clinton recently, suggesting such a move would lead him to oppose impeachment. 

 But Clinton aides fear a trap. If Clinton makes such a statement, they fear, then other Republicans might seize on it as a rationale for impeachment, and a prosecutor might use it to indict Clinton after he leaves office. 

 All of this raises two key questions: Did Clinton commit perjury? And if he did, is that an impeachable act? The answers may well determine the president's fate. 

 Many Republicans say it is obvious that Clinton committed perjury, noting that he flatly denied any sexual relationship with Lewinsky. But the president's lawyers respond that Clinton's sworn statement in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit was far short of perjury. 

 White House counsel Charles Ruff Wednesday once again refused to say that Clinton lied, saying instead that ``the president engaged in an exercise, a hallmark of which was a desire to be as little help to people on the other side of the Jones case as he could.'' Ruff said that while Clinton may have walked ``up to the line'' of lying, he was being truthful ``in his mind'' and ``that is the heart and soul of perjury.'' 

 That is significant because perjury is known as a crime of intent. Perjury can only be proven if a prosecutor can show the defendant intended to lie. But while White House aides believed Ruff's argument against perjury was stellar, it may not be enough. 

 The reality is that House members can vote for impeachment even if they don't think Clinton committed perjury in the legal sense, just as they can vote against impeachment even if they think Clinton did commit perjury. That is because impeachment is a political act, not a court case. 

 ``Both sides of that coin are at work here,'' said former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican who believes there is ``no question'' Clinton committed perjury. ``You don't have to prove a crime to impeach. And even if you believe it is not technically perjury, you can vote to impeach anyway. This is the question for the House.'' 

 While Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr has suggested there are several instances of possible perjury, the main question is whether Clinton lied under oath when he said he did not have sex with Lewinsky. Clinton has said that his statement was ``legally accurate'' because the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case was limited. While Clinton has never directly said that his statement was accurate because he had oral sex with Lewinsky, that is the rationale put forward by Clinton's lawyers. Oral sex was not included in the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case. 

 But Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that were included in the definition. For example, sexual relations was defined in the Jones case as including ``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' 

 The Starr report says Clinton did have such contact with Lewinsky and lied about it. ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, the president touched her breasts and genitalia, which means that his conduct met the Jones definition of sexual relations,'' the Starr report said. 

 If true, that would fall within the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. The president has not directly addressed this assertion by Lewinsky. Instead, Clinton's lawyers have said that Clinton can't be charged with perjury based on the testimony of a single contradictory witness. Since only Lewinsky and Clinton witnessed their encounters, there is no way for a third party to corroborate the extent of their contact. 

 As a result, some Democrats have said the perjury case against the president comes down to whether Clinton touched Lewinsky in a certain manner. Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, has mockingly noted the difference between the famous Watergate-era question _ What did the president know and when did he know it? _ and the current question of ``What did the president touch and when did he touch it?'' 

 Wednesday, Frank said that he believed the president lied when he said in the deposition that he couldn't remember being alone with Lewinsky. But if Clinton did lie, Frank said, then he was alone with Lewinsky. And if he was alone with her, Frank continued, then no one else could corroborate ``who touched what'' and thus no one else could say whether Clinton committed perjury. 

 But Republicans disagreed. Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, said Lewinsky talked to seven other people about her contact with Clinton. ``No matter what anyone else says, to me that is corroboration,'' McCollum said. 

 Even if Clinton did lie in the deposition, Democratic Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said, that does not necessarily mean he committed perjury. Meehan said that because Clinton did not believe he was lying, and because the statements were immaterial to the Jones case, the legal standard of perjury was not met. 

 Nonetheless, Meehan said in an interview that Clinton should reconsider his refusal to say that he lied. Meehan said that in addition to Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey, a crucial number of swing-vote Republicans might oppose impeachment if Clinton were to admit he lied. 

 ``If there are enough Republicans who feel that way'' and could swing the vote against impeachment, ``then Clinton in all likelihood will have to address it,'' Meehan said. ``The vote is very, very close.''
