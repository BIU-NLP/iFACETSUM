A Texas judge was convicted of perjury for declaring that he had used political contributions to buy flowers for his staff when, in fact, the flowers went to his wife. 

 A Florida postal supervisor is in prison for denying in a civil deposition that she had a sexual relationship with a subordinate. 

 An Ohio youth who was arrested for underage drinking testified that he had never been read his rights by the police. He was then convicted of perjury for lying and sent to jail for 60 days. 

 Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 

 But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and federal courts, and statistics on the number of perjury prosecutions brought around the country, show that people are prosecuted in America for what might be called small lies more regularly than the Clinton defenders have suggested. 

 With the House Judiciary Committee's hearings into the possible impeachment of the president set to begin this week. The president's defenders are expected to return to their theme. The president's lawyer, David Kendall, has said that ``no prosecutor in the United States would bring a perjury prosecution on the basis'' of the kinds of questions Clinton was asked about his sex life in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. 

 But interviews with lawyers, legal experts and with a woman who is serving a sentence for lying about sex in a civil case show that, far from being shrugged off, the threat of prosecution for perjury, even in civil cases, is a crucial deterrent in the legal system. 

 ``Symbolically, the sword of Damocles hangs over every perjurer's head, and no one can know whether they're the perjurer that's going to be prosecuted,'' said Jeffrey Abramson, a former prosecutor and an expert on jury trials who is a professor of legal studies and politics at Brandeis University. 

 One statistic on perjury prosecutions has been widely circulated since the president's supporters began arguing that perjury was little more than a technicality seized upon by the president's enemies: Of 49,655 cases filed by federal prosecutors last year, only 87 were for perjury. 

 State courts, where statistics are harder to come by, are another matter. Data supplied by court officials in two states, California and New York, suggest that perjury prosecutions are not as rare as some have suggested. In California alone last year, there were 4,318 felony perjury cases. In New York there were 395 perjury cases last year. And even in the federal system, prison officials said in October that 115 people were serving sentences for perjury in federal prisons alone. 

 The review of the cases offers some support for Clinton's defenders. Perjury charges are brought in civil cases far less frequently than in criminal cases. In addition, the law of perjury is highly technical, with courts sometimes ruling that some obviously misleading statements like those Clinton acknowledges making may not constitute perjury under the law. 

 But the cases also show that, even in civil cases, judges are sometimes provoked by perjury more than by many of the evils they see every day. In the Florida case of the postal supervisor in July, the judge, Lacey A. Collier, sentenced the supervisor, Diane Parker, to 13 months for falsely denying in a civil deposition that she had a sexual relationship with a male subordinate. 

 ``One of the most troubling things in our society today,'' Collier said, ``is people who raise their hands, take an oath to tell the truth and then fail to do that. An analogy might be made to termites that get inside your house. Nobody sees it, nobody knows about it until the house collapses around you.'' 

 Some courts have gone out of their way to say that perjury in civil cases is as important as perjury in any other testimony. 

 In a 1988 civil suit in Georgia, for example, a founder of the Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, David Wayne Holland, was found liable for violating the rights of civil-rights marchers. 

 In 1990, Holland was convicted of perjury for lying about his assets so the plaintiffs could not recover any of the $450,000 in damages they had won. A federal judge in Georgia said the sentence in the civil proceeding would be less severe than if Holland had lied in a criminal case. The judge sentenced Holland to home detention and community service. 

 But in 1994, a federal appeals court criticized that ruling and sent the case back for a sterner sentence. ``We categorically reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise,'' the appeals court judges said, ``that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a civil proceeding.'' 

 The review of perjury cases also shows that, while lies about sex are rarely the subject of perjury prosecutions, there are precedents that come quite close to the allegations against Clinton.
