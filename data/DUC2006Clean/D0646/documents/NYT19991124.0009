NEW YORK _ A former state parole commissioner was sentenced to two years in prison Tuesday for lying to a federal grand jury investigating allegations that New York Gov. George Pataki's campaign aides promised early paroles in exchange for contributions. 

 The defendant, Sean McSherry, a former Bronx prosecutor, violated a sacred public trust when he lied to a grand jury, and his crime was more serious because he did so as a law enforcement official, said Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court. 

 ``It goes to the heart of the administration of justice,'' she said before pronouncing sentence. ``The public is entitled to confidence that when a parole commissioner testifies, he will do so truthfully.'' 

 McSherry, 47, was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in August. Prosecutors said he had lied to investigators and then to a grand jury about a 1996 parole hearing at which a man convicted of armed robbery was given early parole. 

 The robber, John Kim, is the son of the Rev. Nam Soo Kim, who made sizable donations to the 1994 Pataki campaign. A special assistant to the state Parole Board, Ronald Hotaling, pleaded guilty in August to lying to federal authorities who were considering Kim's release. 

 Prosecutors said Tuesday that their investigation was continuing. No one in the Pataki administration has been charged in connection with the investigation of accusations of influence peddling, and Pataki has said no one received favors from the board in exchange for campaign contributions. 

 The investigation began in 1997 after the parents of a man convicted with Kim said that a Pataki campaign aide and a Korean-American businessman had guaranteed that their son would gain an early parole if they contributed to Pataki's 1994 campaign. Investigators later found letters and memos from the governor's office to the parole board concerning Kim and two other Korean-American inmates whose families contributed to the Pataki campaign. 

 The other two inmates were not granted early paroles. The three-member parole board, headed by McSherry, ordered Kim released; he had served four years of a 4-to-12-year sentence. 

 When investigators questioned McSherry last summer about the hearing, he told them he could not remember anything about it. When he was called before a federal grand jury, though, McSherry stated that he recalled a verbal dispute with a parole officer, one who prosecutors later proved had been on vacation at the time of the hearing. He also said he could not recall whether he had known the governor's office had a special interest in the case. 

 In sentencing McSherry, Judge Gershon said that he had lied to investigators and ``volunteered an elaborate and false story'' during his two appearances before the grand jury. Noting that McSherry said during his trial that he believed the events occurred as he had testified and that he had not deliberately lied to anyone, the judge added that ``the jury verdict clearly reflects their disbelief of this assertion.'' McSherry's lawyer, Diarmuid White, said he had filed an appeal in the case. 

 His client is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 3 in a minimum-security federal prison.
