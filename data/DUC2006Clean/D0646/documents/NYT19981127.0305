WASHINGTON _ When the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing Tuesday on the consequences of lying under oath, Republicans will try to show that there is a double standard for President Clinton, while Democrats will say that perjury, while serious, is not an impeachable offense. 

 The witnesses each side plans to call _ six by the Republicans and five by the Democrats _ in the full committee's second, and perhaps, final hearing before voting on articles of impeachment against Clinton reflect the two sides' competing strategies, aides said Friday. 

 ``In the hearing,'' a Republican committee aide said, ``we'll be looking at perjury and its consequences, and whether is it tenable for a nation to have two different standards for lying under oath: one for the president and one for everyone else.'' 

 Tuesday, Republicans intend to call two federal judges, two retired military officers and two convicted perjurers. The committee did not announce the witness list, pending final approval of the Democrats' choices, but aides provided the names. 

 The judges are Gerald Tjoflat of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and Charles Wiggins of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Wiggins is a former Republican congressman from California and was one of President Richard Nixon's staunchest defenders on the Judiciary Committee in 1974. 

 The military officers are Adm. Leon Edney, a former vice chief of naval operations and commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy; and Lt. Gen. Thomas Carney, a former personnel chief for the Army. 

 The convicted perjurers are Pam Parsons, a former basketball coach at the University of South Carolina, and Barbara Battalino, a former Veterans Affairs psychiatrist at a medical center in Idaho. 

 The judges will speak to the effects of perjury on the judicial system; the military officers on the corrosive effect of lying on the armed forces' strict code, and convicted perjurers about the personal price paid for lying, a Republican aide said. 

 Democrats, meanwhile, intend to show that perjury in this case is a peripheral issue. ``No Democrat has alleged that perjury is not a serious legal matter, only that perjury in these circumstances, given the underlying allegations against the president, does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense,'' said James Jordan, a spokesman for committee Democrats. 

 Democrats have invited Leon Higginbotham, a retired judge in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and Elliot Richardson, who in 1973 resigned as attorney general rather than carry out Nixon's order to dismiss Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. 

 Democrats have also invited three law professors to testify: Alan Dershowitz of Harvard University, and Stephen Saltzburg and Jeffrey Rosen, both of George Washington University.
