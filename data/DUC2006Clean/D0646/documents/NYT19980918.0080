Kenneth Starr may have convinced most of America that President Clinton lied under oath, but he would have a difficult time proving in a court of law that the president is guilty of perjury. 

 Politicians have chastised Clinton for ``legal hairsplitting,'' but former prosecutors say he should not be faulted for covering himself legally. They point out that perjury is a highly technical crime that requires such an airtight case that prosecutors rarely pursue it. 

 ``It's very difficult to get convictions on perjury,'' said San Francisco attorney James Brosnahan, who was a deputy in the Iran-Contra special prosecutor's office. ``I don't think Ken Starr understands that.'' 

 If the case wound up before a criminal jury, ``I think it would be problematic,'' agreed Joseph Russoniello, the former U.S. attorney for Northern California. 

 Starr's report focuses on whether Clinton repeatedly lied under oath about his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Five of the 11 possible grounds he lays out for impeachment are perjury. 

 Regardless of what action Congress takes, there is strong speculation that the prosecutor will attempt to indict Clinton for lying under oath. Several legal experts said federal law allows presidents to be charged while still in office. 

 ``It's very dangerous for Bill Clinton to accept the bait when they say, `Come on, admit it,''' said a former federal prosecutor who did not want to be named. ``If he admits he perjured himself, Ken Starr has a slam dunk.'' 

 A conviction under federal law carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 

 Perjury charges, when they are brought at all, arise in conjunction with other crimes. In those unusual cases when someone is charged solely with perjury, it often involves a high-profile figure. 

 The California attorney general has not pursued a perjury charge since the O.J. Simpson case, when Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective, pleaded no contest in 1996 to charges that he lied in court about using a racial epithet in the previous 10 years. He was sentenced to three years' probation. 

 In Clinton's case, Starr has targeted the president's testimony before a grand jury and his deposition in the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones, which was ultimately dismissed. 

 Under federal law, a person who makes an inaccurate statement under oath is not necessarily guilty of perjury. The prosecution must demonstrate that a person knew that the statement was inaccurate and intended to make a false statement _ two requirements that are often raised by the defense. 

 A 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision makes it clear that an unresponsive or misleading statement, or even a half-truth, is not enough for conviction. 

 ``The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to specific objects of the questioner's inquiry,'' the court said. 

 To successfully prosecute a perjury charge, the questioner must verbally box in the defendant so that the false statement can be interpreted in only one way. Any doubt about whether the person understands the exact meaning of the question could torpedo the case. 

 ``It's a crime of words,'' said Brosnahan, who has both prosecuted and defended people in perjury cases. 

 ``The way to make a perjury case is to ask the question 10 different ways,'' said Brosnahan, who has called in linguistics professors to aid his defense of clients charged with perjury. 

 The quality of the questioning may be the key to Clinton's defense in connection with his civil deposition. Lawyers who have read the transcripts said Jones' lawyers failed to ask any follow-up questions of Clinton after he denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. 

 ``I don't know if they nailed him in an accurate enough manner to support a perjury case,'' said Jerry Ladar, a San Francisco criminal defense lawyer who is a former federal prosecutor. 

 Rory Little, a professor at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and a former associate deputy attorney general under Janet Reno, regards the possibility of perjury before the grand jury as a far more serious offense. 

 ``Would you ordinarily prosecute someone for lying about a private affair?'' he asked. ``Probably never, because it's private.'' 

 But if a public official continued to evade the truth after a parade of witnesses testified about an affair, Little said he would press forward with the perjury charge. ``It's the person's arrogance that makes prosecutors want to indict.'' 

 Prosecutors say Clinton's biggest problem now is simultaneously dealing with his political and his legal problems. Clinton must deal with his political future, but he should also keep in mind that he is likely to end up in court. ``This isn't some idle law school textbook argument,'' said a former federal prosecutor. ``This is real.''
