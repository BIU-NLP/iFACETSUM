NEW YORK (AP) -- A man was sentenced Thursday to nearly six years in prison for lying to a grand jury that was investigating the World Trade Center bombing and related terrorism. 

 Mustafa Elnore, 40, of Linden, N.J., had pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury in 1997 and 1998 that was investigating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. 

 ''If I had the opportunity to be in front of the grand jury, I would not make the same mistake,'' he said in court Thursday. 

 Elnore also admitted lying when he said he had never heard of Wadih El Hage, who is among the defendants charged with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998. The bombings killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, and injured more than 5,000. 

 In a statement issued after the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''we will not allow perjury or obstruction of justice to stand in the way of pursuing justice for the victims of terrorism.''
