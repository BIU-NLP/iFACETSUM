WASHINGTON _ In 1989, the Senate removed Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. of Mississippi from the bench for lying before a federal grand jury. ``A single, discreet false statement,'' Sen &UR; . &LR;  Herb Kohl, D-Wis., called it. But it was enough for the Senate to convict him, 89-8. 

 That same year, the Senate removed Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida from office. A Miami jury had acquitted him of bribery charges, but the Senate convicted him of lying when he testified in his own defense at his trial. The Senate found him guilty of eight articles of impeachment. 

 Saturday, the House managers cited both impeachment trials, the most recent to be held by the Senate, as they challenged the senators to hold President Clinton to the same standards when they judged him. The prosecutors implored the Senate to be guided by its most recent precedents. 

 ``The Senate should not establish a lower standard for integrity for the president than the standard it has already established for federal judges,'' Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said. 

 The prosecutors' message was clearly intended for the Democrats who voted a decade ago to remove both judges. They include Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts, John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. 

 But two Republicans voted to acquit Nixon: Connie Mack of Florida and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. 

 Although there are striking similarities between the articles of impeachment against the judges and those against the president, there are also some differences, which the president's lawyers plan to highlight in their opening argument next week. 

 The charges against the judges involved lying about acts related to their official duties. The presidents' lawyers argue that the lies Clinton is accused of telling about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky involved a private matter. 

 The president's legal team also argues that the Senate should apply a more rigid standard when it considers removing a popularly elected president. A section of the Constitution says federal judges ``shall hold their offices during good behavior.'' There is no similar language about presidents. 

 When he was in Congress, Gerald R. Ford noted the distinction in a 1970 debate over an effort to impeach Associate Justice William O. Douglas. He said there was a clear difference between judges, who enjoy life tenure and are accountable for their misdeeds only by impeachment, and presidents, who can be removed by the electorate. The removal of a president in midterm ``would indeed require crimes of the magnitude of treason and bribery,'' Ford said. 

 When he was removed from office, Nixon was in prison, serving a five-year term. He had been convicted of lying to a grand jury when he denied that he had influenced a criminal case. 

 A wealthy oil man, Wiley Fairchild, had asked Nixon to intervene in a drug case against Fairchild's son. Nixon persuaded the prosecutor, an old friend, to dismiss the charges. In an interview with federal agents, Nixon denied that he had had any involvement. And he repeated those denials before a federal grand jury. 

 After the conviction on two counts of perjury, the House passed three articles of impeachment, charging the judge with making false and misleading statements to the grand jury and to federal agents. The vote was 417 to 0. And in 1989, the Senate convicted Nixon of perjury on two articles. 

 When Judge Hastings was impeached and convicted, he had already been acquitted by a jury in Miami of bribery charges. But the House voted 413 to 3 to impeach him in 1988, approving 17 articles of impeachment. Fourteen of them accused Judge Hastings of lying under oath at his trial. 

 Hastings, 62, returned to the public stage, winning a Florida seat in the House of Representatives. A Democrat, he voted last month against impeaching Clinton. 

 The prosecutors also invoked the case of a Nevada federal judge, Harry E. Claiborne, who was convicted of three articles of impeachment and removed by the Senate in 1986 for filing false income tax returns. Like Clinton's lawyers, the lawyers for Claiborne argued that his actions had nothing to do with his public duties and should not cost him his job. 

 ``They were saying, `Cheating on your taxes has nothing to do with being a judge,' '' Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the House managers, said Saturday. ``Do you know what the Senate said? `It has everything to do with being a judge.' '' 

 Next week, Clinton's lawyers plan to argue that his grand jury testimony about the details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky had nothing to do with his job as president.
