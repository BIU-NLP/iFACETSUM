The ``Star Wars'' series has a lot to answer for. In the specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking. Its success, along with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind of movie forever. 

 In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that ``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind.'' It got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still imitated today, 60 years later. ``GWTW'' producer David O. Selznick made sure that every step of the film's conception was covered by the all-too-willing news media: from the purchase of the rights to Margaret Mitchell's novel to the highly publicized worldwide search for a Scarlett O'Hara. If the cable outlet E!, which serves up fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd manipulations. 

 Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to shop around to get made. Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit ``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars.'' And one of the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was stuck inside in the Sunday Arts & Leisure section, and detailed a Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into theaters on time.

 Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the first post-Vietnam War-era movie. That is, the first big movie of its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by '70s cynicism or fear of the draft. (Lucas was set to direct what became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's not that he was unfamiliar with those elements.) The characters _ more archetype than character, really _ lent themselves to the sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so. Luke Skywalker's quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and Superman's feats. 

 It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into hyperspace. If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it might have got the obsessives out of the house. But bringing the trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who were kids when they saw it the first time. And the rerelease also served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace.'' ``Phantom'' is in the unique _ and intimidating _ position of being hyped everywhere for its May 19 opening. 

 The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before. Before ``Star Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from their TVs. Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before ``Star Wars'' was made. (The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it.) Even ``Jaws'' was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out. 

 But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson (''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a movie again and again. ``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation that was running the film industry. They didn't yet realize that science fiction was due to replace the western as the action metaphor that mattered. The evidence, based on the middling ratings of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen. Unless Stanley Kubrick put them up there. 

 ``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No. 1 grossing movie of all time from the box office. It took 35 years, and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as box-office champ. But it took less than three years for ``Star Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star Wars'' in box-office receipts. 

 It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a manifest-destiny hit. They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who had long since outlived their usefulness. (Although Eastwood did go on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his movies. If you need any further proof, just check the layers of dust on top of that copy of ``Honkytonk Man'' at your local video store.) 

 Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,'' along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements, Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit. That is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern. (At the time, it served as a fairly subtle indication that the Force had fascistic implications.) Or the x-wing shootout sequence lifted from scores of WWII dogfight scenes. In the pre-video days, the world of old movies was mostly at the fingertips of film-school students. People who could study them over and over, and carefully decide what to steal _ or, more politely, pay homage to. 

 By hitting so big so fast, ``Star Wars'' raised interest in entertainment, so that now every publication except ``The Watchtower'' sees the virtue of giving movie-related stories big play. But the result is that the generation following every step of ``The Phantom Menace'' before it opens Wednesday is robbed of a sense of discovery. They'll never know the thrill of going to a late show on a Monday night and finding it's sold out. What ``Star Wars'' helped to create, and has now become a part of, is the need to have every element of a film spelled out before it's seen. Lucas and company tried to sidestep spilling secrets, but the Internet is filled with reviews by fans who sneaked into exhibitor screenings. Almost everyone has forgotten the joy of having a hit sneak up on you, of seeing a movie no studio wanted to make blast its way to the top. That's why the world got sick of Quentin Tarantino so fast.
