NEW YORK (AP) -- The Force is with ``Star Wars'' fans, and it's telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend. 

 The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history -- for the still unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans and retailers aren't wasting a minute. 

 In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country decided to open their doors at 12:01 a.m. Monday for an all-night selling marathon of toys based on the movie. Some FAO Schwarz stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m. 

 Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour stores to handle the post-midnight crowds. Many stores planned to limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate sell-outs. 

 By 6 p.m. EDT, some fans were already lining up to get first dibs on the new merchandise. 

 ``We've been getting lots of phone calls and there are already people out there,'' said Randy Perkins, a manager at the Wal-Mart store in Rome, N.Y. ``We expect this to be a busy night.'' 

 Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night surfers with an itch to buy. Internet merchants Amazon.com and eToys planned to open their online ``Star Wars'' stores just after midnight. 

 Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast array of goods -- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19. 

 But LucasFilm Ltd. had signed strict licensing deals that prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information about their products ahead of time. 

 As a result, people had been speculating for months, especially on the Internet, about what the toys and other merchandise would be. 

 ``Right now, people are just frothing at the mouth,'' said Omaha resident Dean Phillips, a ``Star Wars'' merchandise collector. 

 Jeff Van Pelt had already figured out that he'd spend about $150 at Toys R Us on Monday morning. 

 ``I have gone online, gotten a list of things that's expected to come out, so I have an idea of what I'm getting,'' said Van Pelt of Concord, N.H. 

 Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in Denver on Friday got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise. 

 There were eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall, including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Anakin Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker and the man who later became Darth Vader; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side. 

 The action figures retail for $7 to $8, while related computer gear to make them talk costs an additional $20 to $25. 

 A collection of Queen Amidala fashion dolls also was introduced. And there was a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes. 

 Analysts estimate that sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming just from toys. 

 Many stores kept the ``Star Wars'' merchandise locked up until late Sunday, when they began stocking shelves. At some stores, managers were not even permitted to see the merchandise until the last minute. 

 Some stores created a party atmosphere for the late-night crowds. At a Toys R Us in southeast Oklahoma City, there was a costume contest as well as a tent set up where they could watch the first ``Star Wars'' movies. In Omaha, the Toys R Us served cakes in the shape of ``Star Wars'' characters.
