If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie has a timely snack to sate your appetite. 

 McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc., the maker of the popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and eject pellet-size sweets. His company, known for its dispensers of Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a galaxy far, far away. 

 Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' The new dispensers show the heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the furry-faced Ewoks. The company already has other well-known ``Star Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers, Yoda and Chewbacca. 

 More are coming. 

 McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer. 

 ``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars'' collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in Orange, Conn. ``It's a big thing for us.'' 

 It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style. In 1996, PEZ bigwigs trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German word for peppermint _ pfefferminz. ``They loved us, we loved them,'' McWhinnie explained. 

 But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997 _ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored and returned to the big screen. So they were pleasantly surprised when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world. 

 ``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains. 

 Fast forward to 1999. 

 Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family. 

 For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the ``Phantom'' appears. ``I can't tell you (about those) characters,'' McWhinnie said with a chuckle. ``I was at a private showing. I had to sign my name to get in.''
