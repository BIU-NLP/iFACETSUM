Who doesn't remember feeling an electrifying zing up the spine at that majestic blast of trumpets and the ``Star Wars'' title appearing on the big screen for the first time? With innovative special effects and a classic good-vs.-evil theme, the ``Star Wars'' series became a part of pop culture. 

 For ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. 

 The Zing strikes back. 

 That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the ``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May 21, 1999. 

 The first ``Star Wars'' trailer also began showing months before the film's release in May 1977, but after reports of audiences booing and laughing, the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox, quailed and yanked it out of circulation. 

 It was a completely different scene Tuesday night at the sneak preview of the preview in a downtown Manhattan theater. (Its official opening date was Friday, but the movie's Web site, www.starwars.com, announced advance screenings at selected theaters.) The lights went dark, and unlike the typical New York movie experience, the audience instantly shut up. The crowd seemed to be holding its breath as scenes from ``The Phantom Menace'' thundered onto the screen in a flurry of spaceships, aliens, robots and humanoids, all new but vaguely familiar. 

 Set a generation before the original ``Star Wars'' movie, Episode I follows a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, the boy who is destined to become Darth Vader. The cast includes Liam Neesom, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, among others. To see the preview, fans still had to pay $9, the price of admission at most New York City theaters. 

 As soon as the trailer ended and the one for the remake of ``Psycho'' began, about 30 people ran to the theater next door to catch the ``Phantom Menace'' preview again as it began to play after the closing credits of ``Meet Joe Black.'' Ushers discreetly looked the other way as the trailer was being trailed. 

 ``I've been here since 10 a.m.,'' said Chris Bergoch, a 26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms showing the trailer. By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was planning to spend the rest of the night there. ``I've waited 16 years for this,'' he said. 

 Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory. ``No matter what the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the same,'' she said. ``You're friends with everybody in the theater.'' 

 The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new footage and state-of-the-art digital effects. The movies offered nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice versions on television. Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95 CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the ``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom Menace.'' 

 But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _ might work to turn off an already cynical public. ``There are concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew Hindes, a senior writer at Variety. ``Fox knows they don't have to overhype this. You can't have more awareness. If they're smart, they'll be subtle. You could open it cold and it would still be huge.'' 

 ``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit. So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7 billion. ``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm trilogy, cost $115 million to make. 

 No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace'' itself. If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga, which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal themes, it might not. Deep down, past all the special effects and whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental elements of mankind. 

 `` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote. ``It has to do with the powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and suppressed through the action of man.'' 

 Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes. If there's a film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them.
