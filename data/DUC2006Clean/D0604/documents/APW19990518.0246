LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight screenings around the country early Wednesday. 

 ``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,'' said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the doors swung open to get a good seat. 

 It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time. The only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America. 

 ``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge, unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But beyond that you're in a very competitive release period.'' 

 Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than $100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' for the film-opener crown. ``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997. 

 ``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its ancestors. The original ``Star Wars'' is the No. 2 movie of all time. Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in tickets domestically. ``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 million, for No. 7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place. 

 Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof. Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas. The reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious. 

 The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement. 

 More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor.'' 

 Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle. Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.'' 

 Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars.'' It is set a generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee father. 

 The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons beyond recycling. 

 Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial. 

 The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out almost immediately. 

 At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning Tuesday. One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter. 

 ``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' line.''
