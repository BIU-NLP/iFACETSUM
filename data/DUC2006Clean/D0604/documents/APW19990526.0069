HONG KONG (AP) -- A week after the new Star Wars blockbuster opened in the United States, pirated copies have already hit store shelves in Hong Kong and Macau. 

 Pirated video CDs of ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' are widely available in shopping malls for Hong Kong for $3.20 to $3.80, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday. 

 In nearby Macau, the pirated VCDs are selling for about $1.50. 

 The ``Star Wars'' film, which began screening in the United States last Wednesday, is scheduled to be screened in Hong Kong in July. 

 It became the fastest movie to reach $100 million (five days, versus six for ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.''). 

 Despite rampant crack downs by customs officials, pirated CDs, VCDs and software are still widely available in Hong Kong and Macau.
