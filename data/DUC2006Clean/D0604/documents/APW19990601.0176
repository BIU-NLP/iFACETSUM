LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting box-office records, but it is not alone. 

 ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was North America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 days. ``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 1996. 

 But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped ``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever for a romantic comedy. 

 ``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, earned $21.9 million in three days last year. The comparable three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million. 

 ``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between Ms. Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place. 

 Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying. It already holds records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to break the $100 million barrier (five days). 

 ``The movie's like a thoroughbred. We put it on the track every day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th Century Fox. He said families are the key to the repeat business if ``Phantom'' is to thrive in the summer blockbuster season. 

 Universal's strategy to open its films before and after ``Star Wars'' paid off. ``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, was in third place last weekend with $12.7 million. It has grossed $117.1 million in four weeks. 

 ``The marketplace has got to support more than one movie. There are different tastes,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. 

 The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' opened in fifth place. The sci-fi film noir had a disappointing $4.3 million, industry estimates showed Monday. 

 ``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative, tanked in its second week, dropping out of the top 10 list with a gross of $1.3 million. 

 Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 

 1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $64.8 million. 

 2. ``Notting Hill,'' $27.8 million.

 4. ``Entrapment,'' $6.3 million.
