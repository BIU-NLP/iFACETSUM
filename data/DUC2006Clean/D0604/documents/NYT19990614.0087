&LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided, ``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas to pack the theaters once again. 

 You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland are claiming credit for the idea. 

 June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day. 

 In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the much-anticipated prequel. 

 Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office gross chart. 

 It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to 11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday, reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters. ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the ``Phantom.'' 

 But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana, Calif., is paying no mind to the movie pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an attendance dud. 

 ``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day. 

 The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying to spread the word about Fan Day. 

 He's circulating Fan Day fliers. He's making up Fan Day badges that participants can wear around their necks that day. He's even tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host the event. 

 But talk about a phantom menace. Many of his efforts have fallen flat. 

 Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to fans in line. And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan Day arrives. 

 Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before the movie debuted. 

 ``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we made with Fox,'' said Baker. 

 The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first week. But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee. 

 ``They go, `It's been there long enough. We gotta show other movies,' '' Daoudi said. ``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove.' '' 

 But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at Burbank's AMC 14 theater, which is scheduled to begin showing the film in its new digital format starting Friday. 

 AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day. 

 ``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC. 

 Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening. And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top spot. 

 ``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to do that,'' Fay said. ``But anything is possible, especially, as I've learned, when it comes to movies.'' &UR;  &QL;
