SEATTLE _ The Force pulsates through the front door. 

 Turn the knob. Walk in. Slowly. 

 Look out! It's Darth Vader, 7 feet tall, leering in the foyer. His red and green chest lights flash mean and fast. 

 Dash to the bedroom. More trouble. A blaster-toting Imperial Stormtrooper is crouched in a corner. 

 Gotta escape! Where? Think. The back patio. 

 Almost there.... A few more steps.... Oh no! 

 Boba Fett is blocking the way _ and his laser is about to get personal. 

 Doom looms. Then, from out of the blue, a voice of salvation: 

 ``How would you like some of my world-famous spaghetti sauce?'' 

 Welcome to the universe _ actually the Kirkland, Wash., home _ of Lauren Bock, where a zeal for ``Star Wars'' and homemade Italian cooking makes for out-of-this-world fun. 

 Bock and his family are among the top collectors of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia in the Pacific Northwest. He has almost every boxed action figure connected to George Lucas' popular movie trilogy. 

 All told, more than 4,000 4-inch and 12-inch ``Star Wars'' dolls, including vintage items, populate his home. 

 Now, with excitement building for next month's premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' it's boom time for Bock and other collectors. 

 Last week, a video crew from cable TV's Sci-Fi Channel dropped by to tape a show due out in early May. The topic? ``Star Wars'' uber-fans. 

 Bock says he has been spending $100-a-day on stuff related to the saga _ from bar soap with a tiny R2D2 inside to his latest find: Star Wars shampoo. 

 Since the series kicked off in the late 1970s, sales of ``Star Wars'' toys, games, soundtracks and books have topped $4 billion, according to Warman's Today's Collector Magazine, a leading trade publication. And `Phantom's'' spinoff sales alone could break the $1 billion mark, analysts say. 

 In recent years, Bock has forked out tens of thousands of dollars for his still-growing stash. The 57-year-old retired insurance adjuster got his purchasing power after taking a big gamble: He sold off two rental properties and put the profits, along with part of an inheritance, into Microsoft stock in the late '80s. ``My toy money,'' he jokes. 

 A 5-by-6-foot model of the spaceship Millennium Falcon, its gun turrets pumping red lasers, swoops from his living room ceiling. A television, 65 inches wide, blares ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (Bock's favorite flick). The walls of his hallways are blanketed with signed pictures from stars of the space trilogy. Need to go to the bathroom? Be forewarned... eyes from hundreds of creatures from a galaxy far, far away will be on you. 

 But these items are just the trailer before the main attraction. 

 Bock's best stuff is in an upstairs bedroom and in the basement. Both rooms are brimming with ``Star Wars'' paraphernalia: Two pinball machines, two stand-alone arcade games and two wood-and-glass cases chock-full of dolls, ceramic cookie jars and Frisbee-size rubber molds used to make ``Star Wars'' commemorative coins. 

 ``It's just so much fun,'' Bock gushes, his arms spread high and wide. ``God, it's great!'' 

 It's the second Wednesday of April, and Bock's home is officially Sarlacc's Pit _ named after Lucas' omnivorous, multi-tentacled creature with sharp teeth. Pit members have fashioned an appropriate acronym: Seattle ARea Lucasfilm Artifacts Collectors Club. 

 The monthly gathering brings together more than 40 people who watch ``Star Wars'' videos, dress up in movie costumes and weigh the latest flick gossip. They also clear up misinformation _ the bane of the serious collector. But in no way, they insist, do members ``geek out.'' 

 ``We are not like Trekkies,'' says one visitor. 

 This meeting, however, is particularly festive. Maybe it's because the prequel is about a month away, or because the sun is out or because the Sci-Fi Channel crew is giddy to have the members circle a table and parody a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. (``Hi, my name is Bill. I'm a Star War-holic.'') 

 In any case, light sabers are swinging. One pair of excited members, wielding toy sabers that go vhronn
