With about two weeks to go before the release of the new film ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' there are so many ``Star Wars'' sites on the Web that the creator of one site, Jedi Temple (www.spiderspace.net/jeditemple), felt compelled to list his favorite 100. And that barely scratched the surface. 

 Hardly a shred of information or rumor about the $115 million ``Star Wars'' film has escaped legions of wired ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts. 

 ``The information is pouring in like crazy from all over the world,'' said Steve Head, one of a dozen co-editors of The Force.net (www.theforce.net), a popular fan-created Web site that promises Web surfers ``your daily dose of `Star Wars.''' 

 ``We used to have to fish for information,'' said Head, a 33-year-old real-estate marketing representative. ``Now the fish are flying out of the water.'' 

 Many Web fans promptly package what they know (or think they know) and post it on sites that include clever design, often using stunning homemade artwork and computer graphics. There are even homemade films that include take-offs on ``Star Wars'' characters, like ``Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure'' (at The Force.net), one of several parodies made by Evan Mather, a 29-year-old landscape architect in Seattle. 

 ``It's just taken on a life of its own,'' Lou Tambone said of his site at www.starwarz.com. While he said that he is not a ``fanboy,'' mildly pejorative slang for an aggressively obsessive ``Star Wars'' fan, he did mention that the John Williams ``Star Wars'' theme was played at his wedding reception two years ago. And on the wedding cake were figurines of Princess Leia and Han Solo. 

 Tambone, who is 29 and lives in Boston, said the Internet's relatively low cost, capacity for graphics and digital effects, and global reach made it a natural medium for the generation that grew up on ``Star Wars.'' Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television, agreed. ``The core audience of the Internet is the core audience of `Star Wars,''' he said. 

 The strong affinity among ``Star Wars'' fans for the Web has not been lost on the film's producers, who have answered the flood of fan sites with a deluge of hype of their own. ``What we found out was that a great way to communicate with our fans was through our Web site,'' said Jim Ward, director of marketing for Lucas' company, Lucasfilm Ltd. ``Rather than simply being a marketing device, we discovered that it is really a medium for entertainment and beyond.'' 

 The site (www.starwars.com) offers its millions of Web visitors something new: truly insider information, production photographs and the occasional scoop. It was on the site that Lucasfilm first released the name of the film, ``The Phantom Menace.'' It also used the site to announce the company's decision _ since rescinded _ to offer no advance ticket sales for ``The Phantom Menace'' for fear of ticket scalping. 

 When the film's first two-minute trailers went on the Internet last November, Web servers offering the teaser were swamped. When the second trailer went on line in March, more than a million people downloaded it in a single day. 

 But long before Lucasfilm's publicity machine was thrown into hyperdrive, sites like www.jedinet.com, Starwarz and the Holocron (www.holocron.simplenet.com) were lush oases for those thirsting for speculation and gossip about the first ``Star Wars'' film in 16 years. 

 Newsdroid (www.newsdroid.com), subtitled Headline News for Star Wars Fans, recently explored the persistent rumor that Jake Lloyd, the child actor who portrays Darth Vader as a boy in the new film, has had his speaking parts redone by another child actor. On Holocron, articles delve into such weighty topics as similarities between ``Star Wars'' and ``Gone With the Wind.'' One writer notes, for example, that in ``Star Wars'' the ``empire enslaves entire planets; the South enslaved an entire race.'' 

 On several sites there is a petition drive to have a special card in a ``Star Wars'' board game be made to honor the memory of Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan who was shot and killed at Columbine High School in April in Littleton, Colo. 

 Practically every other mouse click on these sites leads to downloadable ``Star Wars'' photographs, screen savers, sounds, animated graphics, fan-made movie shorts and cartoons. There are also links to collectibles for sale and trade, backgrounds on characters, vehicles and weapons, and well-marked ``spoilers'' _ glimpses, with words and sometimes pictures, of the new film's much-guarded plotline. 

 Some Webmasters of ``Star Wars'' sites claim to have pirated versions of the film's shooting script, a kind of bible they use to weed out wild rumors about how the action unfolds in the film. And many claim to have vast networks of contacts and spies working on the film and many of its toy and promotional campaigns who feed the sites with provocative tidbits.

 When ``Star Wars'' blasted into movie theaters in 1977, the Internet was hardly a household word; it would be almost 20 years before the World Wide Web would begin appearing in American homes. And nowhere among the futuristic light sabers and X-wing fighters was there a glimpse of anything that even slightly resembled the Net, which is a shame. If Princess Leia could have just sent the rebels the stolen plans for the Death Star in an e-mail attachment (cc: Obi-Wan Kenobi), she could have saved everyone a lot of trouble. 

 But the Internet and PC-inspired technology appear to be exerting some influence on the look of the new ``Star Wars'' film, ``The Phantom Menace.'' For example, while there is still no explicit mention of anything like the Web on exotic planets like Naboo and Coruscant, there are a series of spiffy view screens that look like Palm Pilots you might find in a galaxy far, far away. 

 In tune with the esthetic sensibilities George Lucas has insisted upon for his ``Star Wars'' films, these view screens have the decidedly worn, retrofuturistic look of handheld computers that have seen better days. 

 ``That's George's whole design philosophy, to make things very believable,'' said Doug Chiang, director of concept design for ``Phantom.'' 

 The view screens, which Chiang said were not really supposed to be stand-ins for laptops and such, appear to be fashioned from alien metals and have organic details, like handles made from animal bones. One even looks like a cross between a hand mirror and an old microphone from the golden age of radio. 

 ``They're small versions of a TV set,'' Chiang said, adding that there was no real equivalent of the Internet in the new movie. Lucas' idea is that technological evolution in the ``Star Wars'' universe occurred quite differently than it did on Earth, Chiang said. 

 The view screens, inspired by drawings made by Chiang, are mostly used in the film to permit characters to see things difficult to see otherwise, like a child who is far away. The view screens are somewhat like computer screens linked to Webcams. 

 ``Well, you see it, but it is never explained in the movie,'' Chiang conceded. ``George doesn't like to focus on the technology.''
