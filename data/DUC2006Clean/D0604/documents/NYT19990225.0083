ATLANTA _ The phenomenon began a long time ago in a cineplex not so far away. Now it's coming back _ in 83 days, to be precise. And leading up to its May 21 release, George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars'' film will be one hyped-up ``Menace'' to society. 

 Next month will bring a new 2.5-minute trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' purported to have more than 100 fresh sequences from the film, featuring battle droids, laser firepower and an eye-popping canyon race. 

 Later, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting Jedi instructor Yoda and the ``Star Wars: Episode I'' logo. 

 And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films. 

 When the movie finally debuts in May, some think its box office take will be staggering, likely topping ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park's'' record $92.73 million opener in 1997. For ``Phantom Menace,'' Hollywood is planning on stepping out of the way. 

 ``You've got a clear path completely around that movie for weeks,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of Entertainment Marketing Letter in New York. ``Nobody's putting anything major out against it.'' 

 Moviegoers haven't seen hype this big since, well, last summer and ``Godzilla.'' 

 ``Hype can kill you, as `Godzilla' found out,'' says Dan Cox, film editor at the trade magazine Variety. ``I expect (`Phantom Menace') will make an enormous amount of money, but I don't know how it will hold up. George Lucas is a little out of touch, frankly. But he can tell a story well. I just wonder if the technology is going to be up to what people are expecting.'' 

 Certainly, people are expecting a lot. 

 Last November ``you had moviegoers paying $7.50 not to see a movie but to see the first trailer (when it was paired with films like `The Waterboy' and `Meet Joe Black'),'' says CNN's Jim Moret, anchor of ``Showbiz Today.'' ``If that isn't pre-opening buzz, I don't know what is.'' 

 One of those fans was Kristopher Graham, 24, of Dawsonville, who drove to Alpharetta's North Point theaters just to see the trailer. He dubbed it ``awesome. It sends chills down you.'' 

 The whole ``Star Wars'' thing ``has come to occupy our culture in a unique way,'' says Matthew Bernstein, associate professor of the film studies program at Emory University. ``They talk about a film everybody has seen like `The Wizard of Oz'. It's occurred to me I'm no longer sure every child in America growing up sees 'The Wizard of Oz.' But you know every one of them sees 'Star Wars.''' 

 And it's not just in America. 

 Recently, Moritz Minzlaff, an 18-year-old German college student in Karlsruhe, south of Heidelberg, posted an Internet message begging fellow foreign ``Star Wars'' fans to join him in traveling to the United States to see ``Phantom Menace'' in May (opening dates outside North America start in June). 

 So far Minzlaff has gotten responses from dozens of fans in Germany, France, Slovakia, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland. He plans to travel to Los Angeles with the group he assembles for the first showing of ``Phantom Menace.'' 

 ``I haven't done anything like this (before),'' Minzlaff says in an interview via e-mail. ``I think it's a crazy thing to do but that's part of the fun. `Star Wars' is something special to me. I've never been this excited about anything. I started counting down the days when the release was more than 500 days away.'' 

 Similar sentiments clog the Internet, which has been littered with ``Star Wars'' sites for years. Activity has intensified in recent weeks with unofficial postings of purported sound clips pirated from the film's production, an alleged frame-by-frame accounting of what moviegoers will see in the coming new trailer and spy reports from London's Abbey Road where John Williams recently began recording the ``Phantom Menace'' soundtrack. 

 Much of the information is housed in sites commonly referred to among the webnoscenti as ``spoilers'' for the obvious reason that they readily reveal anything they can get their hands on. 

 The minutiae is often mind-boggling. Ryan Johnson's www.astheygo.com, for instance, details one script excerpt he's ``99 percent sure that this might be authentic!'' 

 Here it is: 

 Jedi: ``Holy Moley! What's that?'' 

 Anakin: ``I've got a bad feeling about this ...'' 

 Jedi: ``You always say that.'' 

 Some Internet users such as Germany's Minzlaff avoid many of the spoiler sites. ``I'm very much concerned about knowing too much about the story,'' he says. But he does hook into sites like www.countingdown.com at least three times a day for ``Phantom Menace'' updates. 

 Countingdown.com is an obsessive-compulsive nirvanaland. The entrance to the ``Star Wars'' pages contains a digital clock counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until ``Phantom Menace'' opens in theaters. (You, of course, can capture the clock to place on your own computer desktop). 

 Inside are news bits gleaned from media around the globe, posters from the film and spy reports, including the latest gossip on the burgeoning line of upcoming toys. One item, for instance, estimates exactly how many new Lego ``Star Wars'' Mindstorm Droid Developer Kits (each selling for $100) will be available at every Toys R Us this fall. 

 The Internet's ``Phantom Menace'' mania, however, isn't as shocking to some as the mainstream media's handling of both of the film and marketing in general. 

 ``Everybody's talking about the hype,'' Entertainment Marketing Letter's Mayer says. ``The sense in the press is that (the film) is the second coming. The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's no next Elvis. There is just what there is.'' 

 In effect, he says, ``the media is pushing how marketing is done.'' 

 The press has definitely picked up on the ``Phantom Menace'' buzz. Many newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, covered the debut of the first trailer. USA Today has announced it will publish a package of ``Phantom Menace'' stories today. The San Jose Mercury News began a weekly column on the coming film last Sunday. And magazines like Vanity Fair have run extensive interviews. Movieline even featured twentysomething movie and TV stars talking about their favorite ``Star Wars'' characters. (``Felicity's'' Keri Russell, for example, admits she wore her hair in big, tight Princess Leia ear buns for two years after seeing the original film, which debuted in 1977). 

 To CNN's Moret, it's all pretty much justified. 

 ``I don't look at our function as being a marketer of the film,'' he says. ``But if it's being embraced enough by moviegoers to obsess over seeing a trailer, if people are going to camp out to get the first tickets, that's a story.'' 

 With this film, there's a ``clear indication for quality and blockbuster,'' Moret says. ``You don't often have both.'' 

 Plus, he adds, all the hype and all the marketing and all the press and all the Web sites will only be too much ``when the fans say it is too much.'' 

 Is it too much? 

 Certainly not for Keir Larock, 17, a student at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics in Limestone, Ma. In a phone interview, he says he's seen the first three ``Star Wars'' films ``200 times each easily,'' has downloaded from the Internet at least seven copies of the first ``Phantom Menace'' trailer and is organizing via the Web his own group of fans to see the film on opening day. 

 ``I was totally mystified'' while watching that trailer for the first time, he says. ``I saw my reason to live for the next six months.''
