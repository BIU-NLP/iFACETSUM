NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``Star Wars'' mania heating up across the nation, retailers are gearing up for what's expected to be one of the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history. 

 Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its 1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3, the first day that merchants are permitted to sell goods based on ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 

 The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line. 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's biggest retailer, told The Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of ``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3. 

 ``Star Wars''-related goods -- from snack foods to body lotion to skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments in Wal-Mart's stores. 

 ``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. 

 Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming from toy sales. 

 The movie debuts May 19. 

 Merchants expect anxious ``Star Wars'' fans --both children and avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on May 3, hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie merchandise. 

 ``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing virtually all information on their products to the general public, including the media. 

 Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves. 

 Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin stocking store shelves late on May 2.
