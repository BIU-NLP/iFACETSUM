 How are die-hard ``Star Wars'' fans occupying themselves as they wait for the premiere of ``The Phantom Menace''? 

 Fernando DeRosa, a 22-year-old college student from Suffern, N.Y., dresses up as the character Boba Fett and attends sci-fi conventions. 

 The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to assemble and cost nearly $2,000. 

 ``I met Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett, and he told me it was the most realistic Fett costume he'd ever seen,'' DeRosa says. 

 Derek Bruner, an electrician from Houston, Texas, toils away on ``Star Wars _ The Living Story,'' an Internet-based saga set six years before ``Star Wars.'' Brunner's Web page has had 15,000 hits since its debut in August 1997!
