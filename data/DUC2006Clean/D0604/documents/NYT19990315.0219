SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store and Taco Bell near you. 

 In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to open. 

 A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens nationwide. 

 Lucasfilm Ltd., which is producing the movie, has licensed Hasbro Inc., Galoob Toys Inc. and Lego Group to make the toys. Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well. 

 But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging. The company, which has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom.'' 

 Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie, industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second ``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film merchandising attempts. 

 ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication. 

 Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to ``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release. 

 ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'') didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said. 

 Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks, most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint. 

 According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars'' films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie series. 

 They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King''; the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films. 

 The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products. ``With `Star Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade association in New York. 

 ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the film merchandising industry. As a result, Lucasfilm knows this segment of the industry like no other film studio. 

 ```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,'' Brochstein said. Lucas retained the licensing rights to products that used the ``Star Wars'' name. ``Before that, licensing was considered ancillary income. But now in major films, particularly those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item.'' 

 Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom'' merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public interest for the movie. 

 ``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what they're doing,'' Brochstein said. ``They've let things out in dribs and drabs. They make it a game.'' 

 Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed retailers to begin selling three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L. Jackson, the actor who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set. 

 Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full range of merchandise they'll be releasing. 

 Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I _ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces. 

 In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a ``Phantom'' soundtrack in May. Video games from Nintendo and Lucas Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom.'' 

 On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins with the movie. 

 Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters. The cans featuring Yoda will have prizes. Pepsi would not comment on its promotions. 

 Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the Louisville, Ky., parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk about its promotions.
