SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' fan Khari Crowder set up camp Saturday on the sidewalk near the Coronet Theater. Next to him was a big banner that declared: ``I'M FIRST.'' 

 ``If I could be here a month, I would,'' said Crowder, who works for a San Francisco radio station under the name Krazy K. 

 He was among the handful of fans who began lining up at the movie house, hoping to snag tickets to the long-awaited ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The line _ a scene repeated in many other cities _ is expected to balloon as the film's May 19 opening approaches. Advance ticket sales begin a week earlier. 

 It's a long wait and a lot of work for a movie that isn't even officially set to play at the Coronet. But it looks like The Force is with the fans: United Artists Theaters executive vice president Mike Pade believes the deal is ``99.9 percent done'' with film distributor Twentieth Century Fox to book ``Episode I'' at the Coronet. 

 Crowder said he first showed up Friday night but the police told him to move. So he slept in his van, which was parked nearby. 

 He was back in the same spot Saturday, lounging on a lawn chair. He said he was prepared to wait until opening day. 

 ``They don't call him `Krazy' for nothing,'' said a co-worker who dropped by to see him. 

 For other fans camped out, the wait is a minor inconvenience to see the first ``Star Wars'' installment since 1983. 

 ``I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years,'' said A.J. Nappa, a 20-year-old San Francisco resident who staked out a piece of pavement a few feet from the theater's box office. For him, it's not just a movie. ``This is a defining moment for our generation.'' 

 He and friend Joe Buckley began their camp-out Saturday at 9 a.m. Their spirits were up as they munched on pizza and played Monopoly _ the ``Star Wars'' edition, no less. The wind threatened to blow away their Monopoly money. 

 But even then they seemed prepared to weather the nearly three-week wait. Stashed away in their cars were tents, sleeping bags and other necessities. More friends will join them as the days pass, they said. 

 Round Table Pizza, a few doors from the Coronet, welcomes any extra business the ``Star Wars'' hype brings. Assistant manager Peter Kwan said he's used to blockbuster films sparking big crowds, but he's not used to seeing a line form so early. 

 ``I think ``Star Wars' is going to be the biggest,'' Kwan said. 

 Nappa, Buckley and his friends plan to watch the classic ``Star Wars'' trilogy on the eve of the film's opening _ right where they're camped, using a TV, VCR and gas generator. 

 The moviegoers at the Coronet aren't alone in their enthusiasm. Over the weekend, there were signs of ``Phantom'' fever spreading: 

 _ More than 15,000 fans overwhelmed the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver for the three-day ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a Lucasfilm- sanctioned event featuring cast, crew, props and merchandise _ enough to make the most rabid Jedi junkie drool. 

 _ FAO Schwarz, Toys R Us and other chains prepared to open Monday at 12:01 a.m. to hawk long-awaited ``Episode I'' goods, such as plastic light sabers, talking action figures and toy spaceships. Merchandise sales from the classic trilogy have raked in more than $4 billion and the new film is expected to match that. 

 ``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens in 2,500 theaters on opening day, is expected to surpass the $1.78 billion grossed worldwide by ``Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi.'' Some even think it may sink ``Titanic's'' record-setting $1.84 billion worldwide receipts. 

 The $115 million film is a ``prequel'' set about 30 years before the first ``Star Wars'' film. One part of the storyline tells of a 9-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually becomes the infamous Darth Vader of the trilogy. The plot also centers around a brewing galactic war involving the Trade Federation and the Republic of pre-Imperial days. 

 Buckley, 19, tried to explain the appeal of the ``Star Wars'' series that has kept it a cult favorite since the first film appeared in 1977. 

 ``I've watched a lot of movies and that's just the one that grabs you,'' he said. ``The movie's magic is still there.''
