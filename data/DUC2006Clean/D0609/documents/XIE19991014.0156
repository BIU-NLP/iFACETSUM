JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will begin from next week to dismantle 12 Jewish encampments in the West Bank under an agreement reached between the government and settler leaders, the Prime Minister's Office said Thursday. 

 Danny Yatom, political and security advisor to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, met settler leaders here Wednesday night. The two sides agreed to remove 12 hilltop outposts instead of 15 as decided earlier by Barak. 

 Of the 12 outposts, one will remain as pasture land and another as a preparatory school through the end of the school year and their future will then be discussed. 

 The settler leaders, who had opposed Barak's decision, said they were satisfied with the results and promised that they would help facilitate the evacuations. 

 Commenting on this issue, President Ezer Weizman said that the dismantlement of the illegal encampments is necessary and the result could help push the peace process forward. 

 After the first meeting Sunday of a ministerial committee reviewing the policy on Jewish settlements under former right-wing government, Barak informed Jewish settler leaders Tuesday that he plans to dismantle 15 encampments illegally built in the West Bank. 

 Barak said his decision was based on the recommendations from the defense establishment, which found that settlers have established 42 encampments throughout the West Bank since the signing of the Wye River peace accord last fall and their legalities were all in question. 

 "I consider settlement activities in the West Bank, which was always conducted at the behest and with the authorization of the government, very important. But I think the law is of utmost importance," Barak told the leaders. 

 The Palestinians regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as illegal and demand that Israel evacuate all 144 settlements in these areas. 

 They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of 2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start of the final status talks and destroy the peace process. 

 Israel denied it was expanding Jewish settlements, saying that the new housing units are all within the borders of existing settlements. 

 One month after a ceremonial start, Israel has yet to name its negotiators in the final status talks, in which the fate of the Jewish settlements will be dealt with. The Palestinians accused Israel of foot-dragging.
