JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today authorized simpler procedure for granting permission for Jewish constructions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to ease the settlement building freeze imposed by the previous government. 

 The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session, following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month. 

 Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the previous government of handicapping the natural developments of Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on Palestinian buildings. 

 He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish settlers. 

 The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight. 

 However, he stressed that any proposal to build new settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval. 

 Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting. 

 In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision. 

 However, the council also expressed its disappointment that there has been no decision on actual developments and buildings of the Jewish settlements. 

 Also today, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member of Meretz, Yossi Sarid said he had information on government plans for an unprecedented settlement campaign. 

 Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process. 

 Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.
