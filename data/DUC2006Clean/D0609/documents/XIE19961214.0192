AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Serious differences arose between Jordan and Israel over a planned expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher has said. 

 "I've clarified the Jordanian position regarding the settlements and stressed that this constitutes a threat to the peace process," said Muasher Friday when concluding a four-day visit to Israel. 

 "There are big differences between the Jordanian and Israeli perspectives on the issue of settlements," Muasher said after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu in West Jerusalem, according to Jordan radio. 

 Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government decision Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a move that could entice more Israelis to settle in the occupied area. 

 The decision would likely boost construction and investment in the 144 Jewish settlements. The Palestinians sharply opposed the settlement expansion and warned that it would lead to the collapse of the peace efforts. 

 Muasher told Israel TV Thursday that Jordan was committed to working with Israel "to protect the achievements" of peace, but warned that Netanyahu's policies were endangering them. 

 Muasher, who was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel following the kingdom's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state, cited the settlement expansion plans and the delays in implementing the Israeli-Palestinian accords in particular. 

 He said Friday that the construction of new settlements in Ras Al Amud area in Jerusalem and the Israeli cabinet decision to provide additional facilities to the settlement activity posed a threat to the Arab-Israeli peace process. 

 Muasher said that during his meetings with Israeli officials, he stressed Jordan's keen interest and desire to work with all peace-loving forces to push the peace process forward, and to block all attempts to abort the peace process. 

 A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to the Middle East peace process. 

 "The Israeli government remains committed in the peace process with the Palestinians and respects the peace treaty signed with Jordan," the statement said. 

 "Israel is conscious of Jordan's needs for stability and prosperity," Netanyahu told Muasher, according to the statement.
