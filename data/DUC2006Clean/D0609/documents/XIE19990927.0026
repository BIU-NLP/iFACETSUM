JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing construction tenders for settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli peace group here Sunday. 

 After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks 

 The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added. 

 The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion, the statement said. 

 Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the new tenders. 

 Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued under the government's guidelines. 

 Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers. 

 Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement. 

 The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank. 

 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13. 

 The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue. 

 Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories. 

 But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future. 

 Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he will continue to expand it. 

 Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem." 

 The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such remarks. Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is evacuation." 

 "Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
