JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they called illegal settlement expansions. 

 The activists and settlers pushed and sometimes threw punches at each other on the hilltop about three miles from the settlement of Itamar in central West Bank, Israel Radio reported. 

 The visitors called the outposts set up by the settlers illegal, but a spokesman for the settlers said the camps were within the range of Itamar and called the tour of the activists provocative. 

 The tour was cut short at a nearby settlement of Berakha, where Israeli soldiers barred the activists from entering, declaring it a closed military zone. 

 Right-wing legislator Uzi Landau from the Likud party called on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ban similar "provocative visits" by members of Peace Now, a watchdog monitoring settlement activities in the West Bank and Gaza. 

 Since taking office early last month, Barak has pledged to move forward the peace process stalled under the three years of rule by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu. But he has been at odds with the Palestinians over Jewish settlements. 

 The Palestinians have urged Barak to dismantle all the settlements, calling them illegal and inconsistent with peace accords signed by the two sides. 

 Barak has promised to halt building of new settlements, but vowed not to remove existing ones before Israel and the Palestinians enter the final-status talks. 

 The ex-army chief has said that large blocs of Jewish settlements would remain under Israeli control after a permanent peace accord was reached as a result of the final-status talks. 

 Earlier this week, Peace Now said that Jewish settlements are expanding under Barak's government at a faster pace than under the Netanyahu government. 

 The group said in the month since Barak took office, the Housing Ministry has issued tenders for the construction of 1,517 apartments in the settlements, six times the average monthly rate of house construction in the settlements under the former government. 

 The Housing Ministry said the figures were incorrect and tenders had been issued for only 678 new homes. 

 Nearly 200,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 150 settlements which scattered in the West Bank and Gaza, dividing the areas into many isolated parts.
