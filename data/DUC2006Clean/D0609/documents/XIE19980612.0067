JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army ordered Thursday to set up a force of civilian guards to protect Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, an army statement announced. 

 Under an order signed by Uzi Dayan, commander of Israeli Army's Central Command, the civilian guards will be operational within the next few weeks, first at some large settlements such as Ma'ale Adumin, Ariel and Givat Ze'ev, the statement said. 

 Ma'ale Adumin is situated by the road linking Jerusalem and the West Bank city Jericho, Ariel located between Ramallah and Nablus, and Givat Ze'ev between Ramallah and Jerusalem. They are the three largest settlements in the West Bank. 

 Although the army did not give the reasons for setting up such forces, it is believed that this step is aimed at strengthening the settlements and allay security concerns by the settlers. 

 Since its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast War, Israel has created over 190 Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories, of which 173 are scattered across the West Bank. 

 The total population of Jewish settlers stands at around 150,000 and this figure does not include those settlers living in the Arab East Jerusalem, which has also been occupied by Israel since 1967. 

 Jewish settlements is one of the outstanding obstacles that block the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, that has been halted since Israeli construction of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in early 1997. 

 Israeli government's move to create the civilian guards forces also came amid reports that Israel and the Palestinian National Authority are close to reaching an agreement on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank. 

 If Israel accepts the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback, about 18 Jewish settlements in the West Bank are likely to be turned into isolated islands surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas. Citing their security concerns, the settlers have been lobbying rightwing members of the government to disrupt any agreement on further redeployment.
