WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration today expressed concerns over a new Israeli plan to expand the existing Jewish settlement on the West Bank and near Jerusalem, indicating such a move will further erode confidence between the Israelis and Palestinians. 

 During a photo session with Norway's Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godfal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters that she raised the issue during a meeting Thursday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. 

 "It's a very delicate moment in the whole situation, where it's very important to do everything we can to rebuild the bonds of confidence. Within that context, I expressed my concern to Minister Mordechai about the thickening of the settlement," she said. 

 Mordechai announced this week that there is a plan to add 358 housing units to the West Bank settlements of Jenin and Sharei Tikva and several thousand near Jerusalem. And he told a Jewish group in Washington today that the existing settlements "must be able to develop and grow." 

 The Clinton administration has opposed construction of new settlements as complicating to territorial negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, but said expansion of existing ones wasn't a problem as long as it was a product of "natural growth." 

 But this time, the Clinton administration expressed "concerns" as it is at a sensitive time.
