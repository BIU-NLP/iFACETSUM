CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a U.N. conference on Monday urged Israel to halt construction of Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas and adhere to the peace agreements signed between the two sides. 

 Speakers at the opening session of the two-day fourth meeting of the U.N. Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People criticized Israel's settlement policies. 

 "Building of new settlements and expansion of the existing ones have destructive effects on the Mideast peace process," said Seyyid al-Masri, Egypt's assistant foreign minister. 

 The international community was surprised over Israel's construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement, al-Masri said. 

 Israel's activities have aroused fears over the devastating consequences of its settlement policy on the peace process, he added, calling on Israel to halt the settlement activities. 

 Israel, which always has ignored such discussions, did not send a delegate to the meeting. 

 U.N. officials and delegates from member countries also started preparations for a meeting in Geneva next month that could start a process for dealing with Jewish settlements under international laws. 

 That meeting, called by the U.N. General Assembly, is to urge Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activities in the Israeli-occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 

 The Palestinians maintain that construction of Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip violates the convention, which calls for protection for civilians in wars. The convention bans usurpation of land by an occupying power. 

 In a letter to the meeting, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Palestinians and Israel to focus on building peace. 

 "I appeal for the political courage of the leaders on both sides and call upon them to re-embark on the negotiations process in the spirit of pragmatism and statesmanship," Annan said in the letter read on his behalf by his deputy, Chinmaya Gharekhan. 

 Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive peace talks largely due to Israel's settlement activities since hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
