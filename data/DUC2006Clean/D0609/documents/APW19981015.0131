JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank. The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement. The building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the expansion of an existing one, the group said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to accommodate natural population growth. The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about 5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West Bank. Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now. Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would depend on demand. ``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said, noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. ``So far, everything that has been built has been sold.'' Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse. He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built. ``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said. &UR; kl
