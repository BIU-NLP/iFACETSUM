JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Disputing the government's defense of its expansion of Jewish settlements, the Israeli peace group Peace Now revealed in a survey Thursday that a large number of housing units in settlements are vacant. 

 The Peace Now survey showed that at least 2,880 housing units in the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are vacant. 

 Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion. 

 The survey said the population growth rate at the Jewish settlements is only 3.2 percent, while the housing construction is increasing at a rate of 15 percent despite the oversupply of housing. 

 These results refuted the Likud government's claim that the construction of new housing units in settlements is necessitated by rising housing demand caused by the natural growth of the population of settlers. 

 Last year, the U.S. government issued a similar report on the housing situation in the settlements which also showed that a large number of units were vacant. Israeli government strongly denied the report, saying that the settlements faced a housing shortage due to the growth of their population. 

 The Peace Now survey was conducted by 20 teams that it sent to settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to inspect the housing situation there. 

 Photographer Yoav Leff of Israel's newspaper Ha'aretz, hired by the Peace Now to document the activities of the Peace Now, was attacked and slightly injured Wednesday by a group of settlers in the Itamar settlement near the West Bank city Nablus. 

 Israel has built 190 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since it captured them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War. 

 Settlement expansion is one of the most sensitive disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel broke ground for the Har Homa settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem. 

 The previous Labor government in Israel froze the settlement expansion in order to conduct peace talks with the Palestinians, but the right-wing Likud government immediately revoked the ban after it came to power in mid-1996.
