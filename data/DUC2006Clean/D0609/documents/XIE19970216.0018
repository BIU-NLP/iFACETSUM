JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged Israel to cease settlement construction and refrain from actions against Arab residents in East Jerusalem. 

 Speaking on a tour to the West Bank city of Jenin, Arafat said that Israel should abide by the interim agreement it has signed and not attempt to alter it. 

 He criticized Israel's moves of continuing the building of settlements in the territories including East Jerusalem, and canceling state of permanent residents for Arabs living in East Jerusalem. 

 The Palestinian leader said that "the Palestinians were stronger than the settlements and stronger than the settlers." He added the PNA leadership had decided to conduct dialog with the opposition of the Israeli government in its struggle against the expansion of settlements. 

 Arafat's call came a day ahead of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks on further implementing the interim agreement. The talks signaled the continuation of the peace process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron last month. 

 The resumption of the talks was agreed in the summit held last Sunday between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. 

 Eight joint panels will start negotiations Sunday to discuss economic and security issues related to the interim agreement, including the opening of safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the construction of an airport and sea port in Gaza, and the development of economic and security cooperation. 

 The Israeli negotiating team will be headed by Foreign Minister David Levy and the Palestinian one by Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen). 

 A day earlier, Arafat convened a joint meeting of the Palestinian Council and PLO Executive Committee in the West Bank city of Jericho. The meeting condemned Israel for failing to respond to the messages issued by the council on the settlement issue, and called on Palestinians to continue fighting against the settlements. 

 The Palestinian leadership also adopted a resolution to grant health, housing and financial assistance to the 30 Palestinian women detainees released by Israel earlier this week.
