EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement and a violation of peace accords. Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located on a hilltop about 800 meters, or half a mile, from the trailer park. Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural growth.'' The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves in families to the new area. Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. But successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank. Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David. ``It's a new location and new settlers will be there. This is a violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense ministry and would not remain in the area permanently. The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said. ``Every settlement begins with a trailer. They put up a trailer and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,'' said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement, which monitors settlement construction. Noham Ochana, a youth counselor on the site, 15 youths live in the trailers, which he said were brought in about six months ago by a movement serving troubled teen-agers. &UR; lc-kl/dl
