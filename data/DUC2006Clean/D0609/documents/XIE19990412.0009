JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official Sunday expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the peace making between Israel and the Palestinians. 

 Speaking to reporters after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk urged Israel to stop these activities which "can affect and prejudge the negotiations." 

 Indyk arrived in Israel earlier Sunday for talks to enhance the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Cooperation, which was signed in October last year and designed to improve Israel's defense and deterrence capabilities. 

 He said the U.S. and its principal ally in the Middle East should remain coordinated in face of threats of ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the region. 

 But he said the strategic cooperation also has another aspect, that is, to look for ways to move forward the stalled peace process. 

 "The window of peacemaking is closed," he said, citing the frozen agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and the stalemate on the Israeli-Syrian track. 

 He said "some questions have occurred" concerning the U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, referring to the Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, "particularly in central West Bank." 

 For the last two months, Washington has expressed its concern on several occasions over Israel's land grabbing and settlement expansion in the West Bank, saying it is a reversal of Israeli assurance that such activity would not be carried out. 

 According to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, both sides should not take unilateral actions which will change the status quo in Gaza and the West Bank before the talks on final status end. 

 Washington said unilateral actions include Jewish settlement activity on the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians. 

 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the settlement issue during talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington last Friday. 

 Earlier this year, U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross bluntly dismissed the settlement activity as "destructive" to the peace process. 

 Reacting to Indyk's remarks, Netanyahu repeated the government's line that Israel has pledged not to build new settlements but never promised to stop the expansion of existing settlements. 

 Washington has, however, said that the accelerated Jewish settlement activity in the recent months included construction of new settlements as well as an expansion of settlements well beyond their existing perimeters, in many cases involving expansions to distant hilltops.
