JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel. Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank. Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv. Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units. Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment. Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank. For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland. Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready for occupancy in April. He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun. Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze. Ariel was established in 1977. Nahcman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said. Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress. A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony. ``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said. &UR; ml-kl
