GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Tuesday repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final status negotiations and destroy the peace process. 

 "Settlements will have a negative affect on the position of Palestinian negotiators, it will destroy the peace process," said Nabil Abourudeneh, advisor to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat. 

 Abourudeneh made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah after a meeting between Arafat and visiting Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, during which the two leaders discussed the latest development in the peace process. 

 The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four West Bank settlements this week. 

 Arafat has condemned the decision on several occasions. PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo went further by calling it "crazy decisions." 

 Israel denied it was expanding settlements, saying all the new housing units are within the borders of existing settlements. 

 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones. 

 In a move apparently aimed to appease the Palestinians, an Israeli ministerial committee reviewing the settlement policy of the former right-wing government met Sunday for the first time and identified seven settlements as illegal. 

 The seven outposts were among the 42 settlements established in the three years of the former Israeli government. 

 The accelerated settlement activity in the last three years was seen as an attempt by the settlers to grab as much as land before Israel and the Palestinians entered the final status talks, in which the thorniest issues including the fate of settlements will be dealt with. 

 Israel and the Palestinians held a ceremony on September 13, kicking off the long-overdue talks, but the Israeli side has yet to name its negotiators.
