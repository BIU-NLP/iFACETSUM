WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast. 

 U.S. investigators have suggested that a co-pilot of the jetliner may have deliberately plunged the plane into the sea, killing all 217 people aboard on Oct. 31. 

 That idea has been vehemently rejected by Egyptian officials, who contend that mechanical failure is the probable cause, or possibly even a bomb or missile. 

 The new reports from the National Transportation Safety Board, being released Friday, compile the findings of investigators in such areas as human performance, aircraft structure, power plants, maintenance, air traffic control and so forth. 

 But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and do not include any analysis. 

 The probable result will be each side finding evidence to support its contention as the investigation continues into the reason the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea off the coast of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. 

 Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder contained words that may have been a prayer just before the plane went into its plunge. That led to speculation that co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty may have deliberately crashed the plane. 

 El-Batouty had been investigated by a New York hotel's security staff for a number of incidents that allegedly included exposing himself, USA Today reported in its Friday editions, quoting sources it did not name. 

 The allegations were contained in FBI investigative reports into the backgrounds of the plane's crew members, and some of the reports were expected to be released Friday, the sources told the newspaper. However, investigators could not determine whether El-Batouty's behavior at the hotel had any connection with the crash, the newspaper said. 

 In Cairo, El-Batouty's family angrily denounced the published allegations. 

 ''They are running out of things to say, so they are ruining the guy's reputation,'' Walid El-Batouty, the co-pilot's nephew, told The Associated Press. ''They are trying to raise anything to divert people from the real reason (for the crash).'' 

 An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed. The last word was a routine ''good morning'' signoff. 

 NTSB Chairman Jim Hall has testified before Congress that the movements of the plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one of the crew members.'' 

 Also, information from the flight data recorder released early in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off before it was put into a steep dive. Both engines on the Boeing 767 were also turned off. 

 Rejecting that theory, families of the crew members have filed suit against the plane's manufacturer, Boeing. 

 Egyptian officials have focused on possible problems with the plane's elevators, a pair of small wing-like surfaces at the tail of the jet that control the up-or-down angle of the nose. 

 The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during the rapid descent, indicating a major problem. The elevators are designed to operate in unison. Investigators are trying to determine if the split was caused by the plane's breakup, a jamming problem in one of the elevators, crew panic or even a struggle for control by two people in the cockpit. 

 The last contact with the flight came at 1:47 a.m. EST. The pilot's last words after being asked to switch to another radio frequency: ''One-two-five-nine-two, good day,'' followed by an unintelligible utterance, then, ''Nine-nine-zero heavy, good morning.'' The heavy referred to his big aircraft, a Boeing 767. 

 The first indication that something was wrong came seven minutes later. 

 The New York air traffic controller said, ''EgyptAir 990, radar contact lost, recycle transponder squawk one-seven-one-two.'' It was a declaration that the plane no longer appeared on radar screens and a request for it to send out a signal. But that and several other efforts failed to get a response. The FAA estimates that the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four minutes after its last transmission. 

 The investigation also prompted a dispute over who is responsible for paying for the costly investigation, which has included recovering most of the crash plane from the seafloor. 

 Egypt gave the United States $5 million in June to help pay for the search and rescue efforts. That country's share of the cost was expected to be $10.6 million and officials promised to pay the balance expeditiously.
