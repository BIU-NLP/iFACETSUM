WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately. 

 Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said examinations of the jet's remains have revealed no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP reported Thursday. 

 ``No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted,'' Hall said Friday in a statement. ``There is much that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be reached.'' The AP story did not report that any hypothesis had been officially adopted by the safety agency. 

 One official told AP that the Boeing 767 showed no signs of mechanical problems and that ``it was doing what it was supposed to,'' before the crash. Asked about Hall's statement, the official said Friday night that he stood by his original account. 

 Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport. Attempts to contact those two officials Friday night for comment on Hall's statement were not successful. 

 Hall said the NTSB and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority had agreed this week to continue studying the accident, including the voice and data recorders. The investigators will be examining the plane's elevator system, hydraulic components and engine pylons, he said. They also plan to conduct flight simulations at Boeing facilities in Seattle. 

 ``No decision has been reached at this point as to whether further wreckage recovery will ultimately be necessary,'' Hall said. ``Both agencies agree that additional work needs to be accomplished before a final decision can be made.'' 

 About 70 percent of the plane's wreckage was recovered from the ocean floor, following the jet's plunge off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket on Oct. 31. The jet crashed 40 minutes into its 11-hour flight, killing all 217 aboard.
