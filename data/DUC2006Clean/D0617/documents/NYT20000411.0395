WASHINGTON _ Saying that the EgyptAir crash may never be fully understood from the black boxes and the wreckage, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday evening that all planes should have cockpit video recorders, and that the power switches for the cameras, as well as the voice and data recorders, should be moved to where the crews cannot reach them. 

 The board voted unanimously to recommend to the Federal Aviation Administration that recorders holding two hours of video be required in all new planes beginning in 2003, and be installed in older planes by 2005. It said the planes should have enough cameras in each cockpit to see all the cockpit screens and other displays, and all actions by the crews in working the controls 

 Pilot unions oppose cameras as a violation of their workplace privacy. The Safety Board said, though, that it would treat the video images just as it treats the cockpit voice recorder tapes, playing them only for investigators. 

 The board cited several crashes where cockpit images would have been helpful, including two brought down by smoke or fire, Valujet 592, a DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11, 1996, and Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 that crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998. 

 But in Egyptair 990, which crashed on Oct. 31, 1999, as the board delicately put it, ``questions still remain as to the exact environment in the cockpit prior to the upset.'' Publicly, the board has said only that investigators believe that the crash may have been a deliberate act, but its own investigators, and those of other Federal agencies, believe that the plunge from an uneventful cruise fight, which killed all 217 people aboard the Boeing 767, may have been a suicide by the relief co-pilot.
