WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be interviewed by U.S. accident investigators. 

 National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, whose agency is investigating the crash that killed 217 people off the coast of Massachusetts, announced the decision Tuesday to send two staffers to London. He did not elaborate. 

 EgyptAir pilot Hamdi Hanafi Taha sought asylum last week after landing a plane at London's Heathrow Airport. 

 Airline officials say Taha has no special knowledge about the cause of the Oct. 31 crash near the island of Nantucket. 

 Neither American nor Egyptian investigators have released any official findings on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 767. 

 Some U.S. sources have speculated the plane's co-pilot, who died in the crash, deliberately brought the jet down. Egyptian authorities hotly dispute that theory. They say the most likely cause is an unexplained problem in the plane's tail section.
