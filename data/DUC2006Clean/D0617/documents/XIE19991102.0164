CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Egyptian aviation officials and experts, and family members of the Egyptian victims of an EgyptAir plane crash flew Tuesday to the United States. 

 The delegation, led by EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan, included representatives of the Egyptian national carrier and the Civil Aviation Authority, the country's Middle East News Agency reported. 

 Aboard the same plane were 73 family members of the Egyptian victims of the EgyptAir flight 990, a Boeing 767, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern coast of the U.S. shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on the way to Cairo early Sunday. The 217 people on board, including 15 crew members and 62 Egyptian passengers, are all feared dead. 

 The Egyptian family members will later fly from Yew York to the Rhode Island to identify the bodies of their kins provided that they are recovered from the sea, the news agency said. 

 The rescue operations for survivors black box and debris within the next 15 hours, said the chairman. 

 The Egyptian officials and experts, who will follow up the U.S. investigations, carries files pertaining to the history of the Boeing 767 ever since its purchase in 1989 and its maintenance records, Rayan said. 

 He expected the investigations to take time, pending the recovery of various parts of the plane, reassembly of them and the determination of the cause of the crash. 

 So far, Egyptian and U.S. leaders and officials have ruled out the possibility that a terrorist act led to the tragedy. But they, however, also cautioned that it is premature to jump to conclusions.
