CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian aviation officials have demanded that the United States provide detailed radar information on last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash to explain high-speed radar images near the plane in its final moments. 

 A review of the 1,665 pages of documents about relevant investigations revealed a letter from Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato, who complained the withholding by the U.S. side of the radar information, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Saturday. 

 In the documents, which were made public on Friday in the U.S. and presented on the website of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Kato did not give credence to a theory that the plane was downed by a missile, but stressed the need to investigate fully what the Flight 990 crew might have seen. 

 The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after taking off from the New York International Airport on October 31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board. 

 The probe into this tragedy has produced radar data showing three high-speed returns in the area of, and along the path of, the Flight 990. The data shows these returns crossing the plane's path just before it began its dive, Kato wrote to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on June 18. 

 He said that air traffic controllers had cleared the Flight 990 to pass through military "Warning Areas 506 and 105A" just prior to the accident. 

 It was difficult to understand why data concerning the characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he wrote. 

 Kato added that it was apparent from the air traffic control transcript that no FAA controller was actually watching the Flight 990 at the time of the accident and for several minutes after. 

 The continuing Egyptian concerns appeared to question why NTSB staff had concluded that "there were no unresolved safety issues," as asserted Friday by NTSB chairman Jim Hall, who released the documents at a news conference.
