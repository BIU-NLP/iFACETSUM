CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian pilots have demanded the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hand over the probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on Tuesday. 

 The Egyptian Pilots Association wanted U.S. authorities to provide radar images for the investigations and NTSB to question an air traffic controller on duty at the time of the crash, Walid Murad, head of the association, told reporters on Monday. 

 EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff October 31 from New York airport, killing 217 people on board. After over nine months of investigations, NTSB issued a factual report last Friday. 

 While NTSB said "there are no unresolved safety issues," Egyptians have accused the U.S. of denying their access to the radar images on the pretext that they contained military secrets. 

 Murad further demanded that Egypt receive the plane's wreck and the two black boxes, recording flight and voice data, for re- examination, the pro-government newspaper said. 

 If the Egyptian demands are rejected, the investigation documents should be withdrawn from NTSB and given to a third party to reopen the inquiry, he said.
