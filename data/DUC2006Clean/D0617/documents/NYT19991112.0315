NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ The EgyptAir flight that crashed on Oct. 31 went into an extreme dive, making the passengers weightless and pitching the nose down at a 40-degree angle, before the nose pulled back up and subjected the plane and its passengers to two and a half times the normal force of gravity, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday night. 

 Experts said many of the details released Friday might reflect an airplane that was in an emergency, but still under control. But the chairman, James E. Hall, said that the information from the flight data recorder also showed that both engines had been switched off from the cockpit. 

 Pilots experienced with the Boeing 767, the type of plane that crashed, said they could not understand why the engines had been turned off, with the information now in hand. 

 Hall also said that the elevators, the adjustable surfaces on the horizontal tail that are used to raise or lower the nose, moved to uneven positions. It is not possible for the crew to command such a movement on the 767, according to pilots, and the fact that the elevators moved out of unison indicates a major malfunction. But it was not clear from the information released so far whether this was a cause of the accident or a malfunction along the way. 

 The crash, about 60 miles from Nantucket, Mass., killed all 217 people on board. Other than a small quantity of debris and human remains, searchers have not recovered anything except one of the two ``black boxes,'' the flight data recorder, which they are still analyzing. 

 ``Obviously, these data raise many questions,'' Hall said. ``I can assure you they have raised questions in the minds of the NTSB and the investigators. We cannot at this time explain the circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in the flight profile I have just described, and we will not attempt to speculate about it.'' 

 But, he added, the second ``black box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, might explain the circumstances. The Navy believes it has located that device on the sea floor, within a pile of wreckage from the plane, but a robot submarine was still trying to retrieve it Friday. 

 For law enforcement authorities, Friday's information raised questions that deepened the mystery of EgyptAir even as it yielded few clues to guide the inquiry into whether anyone might intentionally have interfered with the flight or tried to bring down the aircraft. 

 The officials said that in the course of their investigation they had examined the recent activities, background, medical history and emotional stability of the crew members and passengers. But so far, the officials said, those inquiries had not provided useful information. 

 Overall, the officials said that while the FBI inquiry was far from over, investigators were faced with dwindling leads and, increasingly frustrated over their inability to help explain the crash, were anxiously awaiting recovery of the cockpit voice recorder.
