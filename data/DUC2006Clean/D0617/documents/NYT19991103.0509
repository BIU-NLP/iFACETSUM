NEWPORT, R.I. _ The mystery of what happened to EgyptAir Flight deepened Wednesday with the stunning word from investigators that new radar data shows the plane climbed 8,000 feet back into the night sky after it had plunged more than three miles from its cruising altitude at near supersonic speeds. 

 The bizarre roller-coaster flight path would suggest the crew was attempting to control the plane as it climbed, though investigators refused to speculate on that. 

 The Boeing 767 climbed back to 24,000 feet, only to dive again rapidly toward the Atlantic, this time breaking up when it reached about 10,000 feet. Radar showed what were probably pieces of the airplane drifting down in the direction of the wind for another 2 minutes and 40 seconds before dropping off radar scopes. 

 All 217 people aboard the plane were killed. 

 At a late-night news briefing here Wednesday, investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said they need to study data from the jet's two black boxes to try and piece together the mystery. 

 But it could be next week before those boxes are recovered from nearly 300 feet on the bottom of the Atlantic off Nantucket Island. A storm that is churning up 22-foot waves in the crash area has halted most of the recovery operations, though a few pieces of surface debris was collected Wednesday, including spoiler panels on the wing, seat cushions, a main wheel, the nose tire and five passenger emergency slides. 

 High winds and rough seas are expected to continue through the weekend, said Navy Capt. Burt March. 

 The Navy has said it needs seas of no more than about eight feet before they can send out the USS Grapple. That ship is the same one that used its highly specialized equipment to recover the recover wreckage of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Swiss Air Flight 111 last year. 

 Until they have the black boxes, the lack of information will continue to frustrate investigators. 

 Veteran aerospace journalists who have covered many crashes said they could not recall a commercial airliner acting as strangely as Flight 990 as it made its final wayward journey up and down over the Atlantic some 30 minutes after taking off from Kennedy Airport in New York on a flight to Cairo. 

 The new radar data came from the Air Force. Earlier, using tracking information from civilian radar facilities in Boston, New York and on Nantucket Island, investigators believed the jet never climbed after its sudden dive from cruising altitude. 

 John Clark, deputy director of the NTSB's office of Research and Engineering, gave this account Wednesday night of what investigators now believe happened in the final minutes of Flight 990. 

 A half hour out of Kennedy, flying at 33,000 feet, the Boeing jet suddenly entered a steep but straight dive, down to 16,700 feet. 

 At that point, information was lost from the plane's transponder, which provides information to air traffic controllers about a plane's altitude. The Air Force radar, though, continued to track the plane down to 16,000 feet. Early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet. Then the plane, its transponder still out, climbed back to 24,000 feet, when it began a rapid descent to 10,000 feet where radar showed multiple targets, indicating it had broken up. 

 ``It stopped being a flying airplane,'' Clark said. 

 Clark would not speculate on what kind of event could have triggered the initial dive, or whether the sudden climb indicated the pilots were struggling to regain control of the huge jet. 

 In addition to the new radar data, investigators also provided more detail Wednesday night about the deactivated thrust reverser on the twin-engine plane. 

 It was deactivated before the plane left Cairo on the first leg of its trip to Newark. It then flew to Los Angeles and then to Kennedy before leaving on its last and fatal leg. 

 Greg Phillips, the NTSB's chief crash investigator, said the NTSB is sending someone to Cairo to check the plane's maintenance records and better understand what prompted maintenance crews to deactivate the thruster on the plane's left engine. 

 Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed in flight, he said. 

 Because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed, there has been speculation that may have been what happened on Flight 990. 

 But Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, stressed again at Wednesday night's briefing, ``We have no evidence at this time that the thrust reverser system played any role in this accident.'' 

 While the black boxes can provide important clues to the crash, it could takes many months or even years before the safety board issues a final report on the probable cause of the accident. 

 The safety board is still investigating the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in these same waters. A final report is not expected until at least the spring of next year.
