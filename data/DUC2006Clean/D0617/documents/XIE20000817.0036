CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan said on Thursday he is "99 percent sure" that a technical problem rather than a suicidal pilot brought down an EgyptAir plane last October. 

 Rayan told a news conference that he is almost certain that there is something wrong in the elevator control system, citing as evidence a Boeing service bulletin earlier this week. 

 The elevators are movable panels on the horizontal tail surface which direct the aircraft's nose up or down. 

 The plane's manufacturer, Boeing Co., urged on Tuesday all airlines flying the Boeing 767s to perform a special inspection to ensure the integrity of parts that help move elevators, but said the stepped-up inspection is not connected to the crash probe. 

 The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board. 

 U.S. investigators hinted the relief co-pilot, Gameel el- Batouti, "brought down the plane in a suicidal act." The Egyptian side has strongly opposed the speculations, stressing technical failure might cause the tragedy. 

 Egyptian and U.S. investigators "were seeking to know exactly what happened to the EgyptAir plane," Rayan said. 

 The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "has given credence to the Egyptian theory" that a prevalent malfunction in the elevator control system could result in a fatal accident, referring to FAA's decision to intensify inspection of Boeing 767s' elevator system.
