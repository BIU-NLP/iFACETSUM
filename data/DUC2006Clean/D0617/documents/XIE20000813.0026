CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Pilots Association chief Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they saw a shooting fireball near the crash site. 

 The testimony of the German and Jordanian pilots must be heard regarding their sighting of missile-like bodies in the same place the Egyptian plane went down, Murad told reporters. 

 According to documents released on Friday by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a Royal Jordanian co-pilot saw a fireball in the sky on the same day after leaving the same airport as the doomed EgyptAir flight. 

 The pilot of Flight RJ262 from New York's John F. Kennedy airport on October 31 last year reported that his co-pilot made the sighting shortly after the takeoff while he had his head down. 

 The co-pilot said that he saw a fireball like a shooting star passing ahead at the Jordanian plane very close from right to left going down, the pilot wrote, as cited by Egyptian investigators in the NTSB documents. 

 The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path clearance as the EgyptAir plane. 

 The head of the Egyptian Pilots Association asked for the pilots to be interviewed again and accused U.S. investigators of deliberately ignoring problems that hold the key to explaining the crash. 

 Murad joined Egyptian investigators in demanding the release of classified data regarding three high-speed radar images passing near EgyptAir Flight 990 just before it began its dive into the Atlantic. 

 "The absence of this information removes the credibility of the American investigators," he said. 

 Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato has complained the withholding by the U.S. side the radar information for reasons of classified military data. 

 It was difficult to understand why data concerning the characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he wrote in a letter to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in June. The letter was included in the investigation documents. 

 All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
