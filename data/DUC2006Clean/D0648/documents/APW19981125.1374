INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The antidepressant drug Prozac can significantly reduce symptoms associated with panic disorder, according to a study. The study, published in the November issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry, shows that the drug can significantly reduce symptoms associated with panic disorder. Panic disorder includes recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. It can also cause behavioral changes and excessive worry. At least 3 million people in the United States _ about 1.6 percent of adults _ will suffer from panic disorder at some point in their lives, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The National Mental Health Association said about half of people who suffer from panic disorder develop the condition prior to age 24. Prozac has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia nervosa. This is the first study to examine Prozac's role in fighting panic disorder. The study was funded by a grant from Lilly Research Laboratories, a division of Eli Lilly and Co., maker of the drug. &UR; ___ &UR; Rare stegosaurus skeleton to be exhibited next year in Denver DENVER (AP) _ After 145 million years, a stegosaurus nicknamed ``Spike'' has been reunited with his skull and tail. The full stegosaurus skeleton, unearthed six years ago and described as the most complete such specimen ever found, is being reassembled at the Denver Museum of Natural History for an exhibit early next year. Paleontologist Bryan Small discovered the stegosaurus in June 1992 about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Colorado Springs. It is one of only three full stegosaurus skeletons ever unearthed, all of them found in Garden Park since 1886. Small's stegosaurus will join the museum's other complete stegosaurus fossil, which was discovered in 1937. The one found in 1886 is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Since Small's discovery, the fossil's head and tail sections have been displayed at the Denver museum, while preparation work on the body continued at Dinosaur Depot in Canon City. On Nov. 17, the body parts, encased in plaster, were brought by flatbed truck to the museum where they will be reunited with the tail and head. &UR; ___ &UR; Health experts tell Americans to forget cars, get more exercise WASHINGTON (AP) _ Government health experts, concerned about the United States' love affair with the car, are trying to cool the romance. It's for their own good, they say. Americans are not getting enough healthy physical activity, and would be better off if walking or biking were a bigger part of daily life, the experts say. One way to get Americans on their feet is to get them out from behind the wheel. ``Nationally, 7 percent of all trips are nonmotorized,'' said health scientist Rich Killingsworth of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``We'd like to see that double to 14 percent over 10 years.'' The percentage of motorized trips would have to drop commensurately, he said. Think it can't be done? The CDC scientists are more optimistic. They note that many Americans have learned to quit smoking and curb their tastes for fatty foods, thereby reducing their risks of lung cancer and heart disease. The experts figure that, if government nagging can help Americans to control addiction and appetite, then encouraging them to go for a nice walk or a bike ride isn't too much to expect. The research groundwork has been laid. Exercise scientists have found that moderate activity _ the energy equivalent of brisk 30-minute walks five days a week _ can lift adults out of the sedentary category that carries the highest risk for premature death. The agency believes sedentary living is a primary factor in at least 200,000 deaths a year from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Those findings underlie CDC's exercise guidelines, which call on Americans to do at least that much activity by walking, biking, gardening, housework or whatever else fits their lives. If one half hour is inconvenient, the activity can be split into blocks of roughly 10 minutes each, the guidelines say. Americans don't seem to be listening. Eighty percent of American adults don't get their 30 minutes, CDC figures show.
