Liz Brown believes in saying thanks _ out loud, every day, over and over, to particular persons and to the universe in general. 

 ``It's such a transformational experience,'' says Brown of Kansas City, Mo. ``Saying thank you is really a powerful statement. I think it keeps the flow of good coming my way. 

 ``I find myself saying thank you a lot, for every little thing. It's amazing how many little things there are in a day ... the parking space that happens to be open, the phone line that frees up, the light that happens to change when you need it.'' 

 The day we set aside to eat turkey and pumpkin pie is also the day when many of us make a point of saying thanks. But there's a powerful case to be made for living the grateful life day in and day out. 

 Gratitude, Brown says, is ``the easiest way to get more out of life.'' 

 Lark Mason, a social worker who counsels patients in her Overland Park, Kan., office, say that the issue of gratitude, or a lack of it, comes up often in counseling sessions. 

 ``Part of what I do, and I think most therapists do, is to help people broaden their perspective,'' she says. ``When there's a specific issue they're grappling with, they tend to hyperfocus on it and see that as the only thing in their lives. An important part of therapy is to look for what is right, what is good and help them get some emotional balance.'' 

 And that, she says, doesn't necessarily come naturally to many of us. 

 ``I think there is some tendency within human nature to become accustomed to the way things are. And because of that, it's easy to begin to take things for granted. It's a conscious choice to begin to focus on showing appreciation.'' 

 A few years back, Lora Manny suspected that a lack of appreciation might be at the root of some of her frustrations and unhappiness. She'd allowed herself to be caught up in the rat race. The Merriam, Kan., resident was ``trying to climb the corporate ladder and doing it for all the wrong reasons.'' 

 Promotions, the legal secretary figured, would get her more money so she could buy more things. 

 Manny took a class on prosperity and gratitude. The group's mission: to become more consciously grateful. 

 One important tool toward that end was a journal in which Manny daily made note of that which deserved her thanks. 

 ``The theory was to quit focusing on what you don't have and focus more on being content with what you have.'' 

 She has found it effective. 

 ``It has a great calming effect. It quieted an urge to be more of a consumer. It reminds me that that isn't what I'm about.'' 

 Documenting her good fortune on paper, she says, ``has made me aware of how many things are more important than the material. When faced with a crisis of any sort, all that stuff fades away, and you focus on people you love.'' 

 Mason sometimes assigns her patients homework about gratitude. She might ask them to list five ways in which they could show appreciation to family members, or 10 things they appreciated during the previous week. 

 ``It can be a good cup of coffee, or `My spouse made a wonderful meal,' or `I got to go to a play.' '' 

 Noticing beauty and goodness ``is part of being alive,'' she says. But she says it also equips one to cope with difficulties. 

 ``I think if you can maintain that focus, whatever life's ups and downs are, you can ride them out much more positively.'' Mason has known people with chronic illness to report experiencing their diagnosis as a wake-up call to everything they do have _ a home, friends, food to eat, a rewarding job. 

 ``It's easy not to notice those things unless you consciously pay attention. If you pay attention, you can have peace and a sense of God's abundance.'' 

 Indeed there's nothing like losing it all, or coming close, to focus the mind on what one has, as Liz Brown found. 

 One of her bothers died 18 years ago. For the family, it was a hard but helpful lesson. 

 ``Through his death we started saying `I love you' more and seeing how life is to so fragile and temporary. You have to get to the point where things are taken away, or almost taken away, and then you wake up and see beauty that surrounds us.'' 

 Brown got a second lesson seven years ago following ``a pretty horrible descent into drugs and alcohol.'' 

 Being in the grip of addiction severed her connections ``to people, to the planet, to life. It's like being an automaton.'' 

 As Brown got control over her addiction with the help of several treatment centers, Alcoholics Anonymous and a halfway house, she says she had a spiritual epiphany and gained ``new eyes'' and that little by little, she ``noticed the power of gratitude.'' 

 In addition to verbalizing her thanks frequently each day, Brown says she tries to abide by another related rule: Never to allow a kind thought to go unspoken. 

 ``If I hear someone say something nice about someone, I always make it a point to pass it along. Even strangers, I'll tell them, `That's a beautiful dress.' It's like a chain reaction. People just light up. The more we hear of that, it really lifts all of us up. I feel it's a trickling effect. It breeds good energy.''  &LR; brk:Time enough for thanks 

 In fact there is evidence that we can breed our own good psychological energy and even alter the way messages are passed from one brain cell to the next. 

 ``The research indicates that repetitive thought patterns ... do result in changes in brain function'' and ultimately in one's mood and attitude, says Joseph Coyle, chairman of the psychiatry department at the Harvard Medical School. ``We don't know yet precisely what are the underlying molecular processes that do that. But the concept that mental practice can change brain function is pretty well demonstrated.'' 

 The notion that we can moderate our moods by manipulating our thoughts in a certain direction is at the heart of cognitive therapy, a widely practiced form of psychotherapy. 

 Coyle cited one recent study done at the University of California-Los Angeles that found that among a group of 20 people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, those treated with cognitive therapy showed just as much change in brain function as did those who were treated with drug therapy. 

 Arthur Brody, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA, recently did a similar study on a group of depressed patients. He, too, found that so-called talk therapy caused as much change in brain function as did drug therapy. 

 All of which should give encouragement to those who would cultivate a more appreciative attitude toward life. Carol J. Meyer of Roeland Park, Kan., firmly believes we have the power to grow more grateful. However, certain aspects of modern life tend to get in the way of gratitude, says the onetime Catholic nun who now runs a spirituality ministry she calls WisdomWays. 

 ``Everybody's in too big a hurry. Part of it is getting in the moment and letting go of worry and fear. 

 ``I go for walks most days. When I'm there, I focus on seeing what is around me and not thinking the whole time. It's like a meditation where I say, `I'm seeing these trees and clouds and breathing this air and being with what's around me.' 

 ``When I eat by myself, I don't watch TV, I don't read. I strive to be mindful of what I'm doing and the joy of that and being grateful, thanking the food, as it were.'' 

 Cathy Noelker-Pendleton also says the hurried pace has pushed gratitude to the side and perhaps off the slate altogether. A social worker in private practice in Johnson County, Noelker-Pendleton often gives her patients a nudge in that direction. 

 ``I urge people to take those moments, a few in the evening, a few in the morning, even before they get out of bed, (to give thanks) that they are able to get out of bed, for their health, for friends and family.'' 

 When people tell her they don't have time, and they do tell her that, Noelker-Pendleton says to herself, ``They don't have time not to say that.'' 

 Meyer, too, doesn't buy the argument that appreciation takes too much time. When you're walking out the door at the end of a workday, she says, you might as well be looking at the sunset.
