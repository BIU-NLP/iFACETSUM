LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Anxiety disorders, America's most common mental illness, largely go untreated because of shame, fear and embarrassment, according to a nationwide poll released Wednesday. 

 The poll release by the National Mental Health Association found more than half of Americans believe that stigma prevents individuals with anxiety disorders from seeking treatment, despite a surprisingly high recognition of the illness. 

 According to the association, 19 million Americans suffer from anxiety disorders, and fewer than one third receive treatment. 

 "These findings account for the wide occurrence between the common accurrance of anxiety disorders and the low numbers in treatment," the association president Michael Faenza said in a statement. 

 The shame associated with anxiety disorder is "completely unfounded," he said. "Anxiety disorders are real illnesses that deserve the same level of understanding and treatment as diabetes, arthritis or heart disease." 

 Stigma, such as the fear of being perceived as weak, appears to be based on misinformation, the association said. Though 81 percent of those polled were aware of anxiety disorders, 61 percent wrongly believe that they occur in people who lack the will power to cope with everyday life stress, are usually caused by underlying guilt, or will go away if ignoring them. 

 But the association said that the study also yielded one hopeful conclusion. The more people recognized that anxiety disorders are real illnesses, the less likely they were to have misperceptions about the their root causes and more likely they were to believe that medical and psychological treatments work. 

 "Education is still vital," Faenza said. "Americans need to know the real deal about anxiety disorders, their signs and symptoms and their causes. Since people with anxiety disorders are at high risk of suicide, eradicating misunderstanding and stigma with a good dose of the facts can really save lives." 

 The National Mental Health Association has launched an anxiety disorders public education campaign, which will target both the general public and primary care physicians. Many doctors are not trained to detect or treat anxiety disorders and frequently individuals go misdiagnosed or untreated, said the organization. 

 According to the association, the illness includes panic, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety disorders and phobia such as social phobia. Symptoms of these disorders include panic attacks, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares and frightening physical symptoms. Each anxiety disorder has emotional, psychological and biological underpinnings and can be treated through targeted psychotherapy, medications or a combination of the two. 

 Anxiety disorders cost the United States 46.6 billion dollars each year, nearly one-third of the nation's total mental health bill of 146 billion dollars, according to the association.
