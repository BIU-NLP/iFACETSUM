&QL; The literature of depression is enjoying something of a boom, which is an odd way of putting it, I suppose. There's no doubt that depression is proving a rich source of material for memoirists. 

 Memoir writing in general is taking a lot of heat. There are too many bad memoirs being published, some critics say, too much pointless sharing of pain and solipsistic navel-gazing. In some cases, the criticism is probably valid. But a well-written memoir that speaks to the reader's experience is a gift. Martha Manning's ``Undercurrents'' is one of these, a beautifully executed account of the author's descent into depression and her long recovery. 

 This column is prompted by Mental Health Awareness Week, which ends today. Of course every week is mental health awareness week for some of us, whether we like it or not. One of the aims of the official week is to lift the stigma of mental illness by helping people understand that it's a disease of the brain, not a character flaw. 

 ``Undercurrents'' is particularly appealing because of Manning's remarkable wit. It may seem unlikely that someone could find anything funny about depression, but the illness has its absurd elements, as many who've struggled with it know. Manning, a psychotherapist and college professor in Washington D.C., kept a diary. She describes her life unraveling, in small ways at first. Work piles up on her desk. Her house is so filthy her cleaning woman is reluctant to tackle it. She can't sleep. She dresses like a bag lady. She feels overwhelmed by her patients' problems. 

 Eventually, deeply depressed, she checks herself into a psychiatric unit: ``I sit on my bed, blankly staring into space. A bassett hound walks by my door. I blink hard. Then two chihuahuas prance by. A loudspeaker announces that `pet therapy' is beginning in the lounge. Pet therapy? Jesus Christ, this is worse than I thought.'' 

 Manning's training as a psychotherapist lends a dimension to her observation of her illness and recovery. The same is true of Lauren Slater, a psychologist whose recently published ``Prozac Diary'' is a sharply observed memoir about her 10-year affair with the drug of the decade. Slater's writing is both eloquent and economical. Her description of her first responses to Prozac are, as she writes, ``miracle-tinged,'' and she describes them beautifully. 

 Slater's book sheds light on an area that is only beginning to be explored, the experiences of long-term users of the new antidepressant drugs. Prozac giveth, but it also taketh away. Those who use it may lose their depression, but they may also feel that they have lost all or part of themselves. 

 Like Manning, Slater has darkly humorous moments, as when she's writing about Peter Kramer, author of ``Listening to Prozac,'' and his notion that Prozac is ``cosmetic psychopharmacology,'' that makes users ``better than well.'' To Slater, Prozac is, ``the Elizabeth Arden of psychopharmacology, a veritable chemical `makeover,''' a word that implies trickery, ``an artful application of powders and creams to hide unsightly blemishes.'' 

 Slater has many doubts about the drug that transformed her life, that enabled her to leave behind depression, anorexia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. After she began taking Prozac, she earned graduate degrees from Harvard and Boston University, married, took a job managing an outpatient clinic in East Boston, in short, was able to live a ``normal'' life. But she wonders what happened to her self, her original self, before Prozac. ``How much, I say to myself, has it cost?'' Her ambivalence about the drug, her questions about its effect upon her life, make ``Prozac Diary'' fascinating.
