A condition called ``social anxiety disorder'' this week joined the long list of downers in life _ including obesity, impotence, and depression _ that Americans once commonly saw as challenges of willpower and character but can now have treated by popping a pill. 

 The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Paxil, a popular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive disorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may conjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before speaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party. 

 But area specialists stressed Thursday that the pill will work only for treating the kind of acute, irrational shyness that devastates people's careers and social lives. Anyone who thinks taking one to feel more confident or convivial in a special occasion, they said, will have trouble getting a prescription filled and is bound to be disappointed if they try. 

 ``We're not talking about people who are a little anxious about giving a talk or business presentation or feeling a little nervous about meeting strangers,'' said Dr. Mark Pollack, director of the Anxiety Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. 

 Rather, Pollack and others said, acute social anxiety involves such intense and irrational levels of shyness that it leads people to shun others, avoid seeking promotions at work, drop out of school, or feel terror at the prospect of signing a check in public or using a public restroom. Some people resort to alcohol or drugs to stave off the feelings. 

 Paxil is the first drug approved by the FDA specifically for treating social anxiety disorder. Epidemiological studies have found that acute social anxiety is the third most common psychiatric disorder in the United States after depression and alcoholism, affecting up to 13 percent of Americans. 

 Paxil, from the class of psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft, must be taken for several weeks before patients see a marked change. 

 ``You don't get any effect if you take one now and then,'' said Dr. Jonathan Cole of McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., a Harvard psychiatry professor and pioneer in the field of psychoactive drugs who has worked in the field since 1956. 

 While there have been widespread reports of people abusing Viagra in hopes of enhancing their sexual performance, or taking prescription weight-loss drugs intended for the morbidly obese just to shed 15 pounds, Cole sees little likelihood of social wallflowers abusing Paxil. 

 ``They aren't likely to be abused by anyone, because they don't work that way,'' Cole said. 

 Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America and a private-practice clinical social worker in Washington, said she hopes a publicity blitz planned by Paxil manufacturer SmithKline Beecham will raise awareness of social anxiety disorder and lead more people to seek help, which could include psychotherapy instead of drugs. 

 The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs have boomed into a $7 billion-a-year global market, with Paxil second only to Prozac in sales, but analysts disagree over how large a market Paxil might find for treating social anxiety disorder. 

 ``Social phobia has been so grossly underdiagnosed and undertreated,'' Ross said. She has seen patients who wake up every morning tallying with dread the people they will have to say ``hello'' to during the day, hate eating lunch with anyone, or who will only go to the supermarket late at night because they want to minimize encountering other shoppers. 

 ``These people are living in a constant state of nightmare,'' Ross said. ``All of us from time to time feel shy, and there are situations where it is natural and healthy to feel uncomfortable, but this is a situation where the shyness is so intense and pervasive that the person makes very negative changes in their life to deal with it.'' 

 Paul K. Ling, a clinical psychologist, said he fears that ``a great mistake would be a reliance on Paxil alone'' or pressure by health plans to push Paxil as a cheaper alternative to therapy. Many people, he said, can have their social anxiety eased by exercises that help them see many of their fears are groundless or irrational. 

 ``I do feel ambivalent about the approval of this use of Paxil, because there is the danger that it is just another example of how we are moving toward a pop-a-pill culture,'' Ling said. 

 However, Pollack of the MGH said the much greater danger is not that people will try to abuse Paxil, but that people with social anxiety disorder will not seek help ``when they have something that is treatable, and they can do better and function better in life.''
