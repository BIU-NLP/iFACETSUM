MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Wallingford man who claims an overdose of Prozac made him insane, leading him to rob banks and a department store, has been found innocent by reason of mental disability or defect. In a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge Richard Arnold on Thursday found Christopher DeAngelo, 28, innocent of the 1997 robberies. 

 "This is not a case of somebody pulling a fast one or being too clever," said DeAngelo's attorney, John Williams. "The hard indisputable fact of this case is that this young man was driven to commit crimes by a prescription drug." 

 State psychiatrists in July supported the findings of defense experts, concluding that DeAngelo's actions at the time of the robberies were linked to his Prozac intake. 

 Arnold ordered DeAngelo committed to the custody of the state Department of Mental Health for 45 days. After that time, a competency hearing will be held to determine if he should be freed or remain institutionalized. 

 DeAngelo was taking Prozac to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, which a psychiatric evaluation suggested may have been caused by Lyme disease.
