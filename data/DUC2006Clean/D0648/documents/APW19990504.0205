LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- After arresting a man accused of supplying a handgun to student killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, detectives kept up their search for those who may have known what the pair had planned for Columbine High. 

 Mark Manes, 22, was arrested Monday on suspicion of providing a handgun to a minor. The charge carries a maximum six years in prison. 

 ``He admits giving the weapon. He was horrified,'' Manes' attorney, Robert Ransome, told The Denver Post in today's editions. 

 Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be used for, but Ransome said his client knew nothing of the impending massacre. 

 The semiautomatic TEC DC-9 was one of four guns used by Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, in the April 20 attack. Twelve students and a teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded before the attackers committed suicide. 

 The arrest came as Columbine's 1,900-plus students made an eager but uneasy return to class at nearby Chatfield High School. 

 ``Every loud noise, you freak out,'' said Samantha Roman, a 16-year-old Columbine sophomore. ``But it makes us feel more secure once you see all the police and stuff.'' 

 Manes, a Littleton resident who once attended Columbine, was released from jail after posting bond. 

 Manes, who is scheduled to make his first court appearance May 10, was the first person since the shootings to be arrested on charges of helping Harris and Klebold arm themselves. 

 Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend, purchased the other three weapons used -- two rifles and a shotgun -- and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 18-year-old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles and shotguns. 

 Police are still trying to find others who may have known the killers' plans, though detectives appeared to all but rule out a third gunmen inside the school during the attack. 

 ``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 

 But, ``our people are definitely leaning toward the good possibility that Harris and Klebold were the only people in the school that day,'' Davis said. 

 Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and the TEC DC-9 pistol. It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. 

 Manes could face stiffer charges if authorities conclude he knew of the gunmen's plans at the time he allegedly supplied the gun, officials said. 

 Also Monday, the coroner's office said Harris had the anti-depressant Luvox in his system at the time of the attack. Before the attack, the Marine Corps rejected Harris' application for enlistment after learning he used the drug. Luvox is commonly used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and is also used to treat depression. 

 Students from both high schools shared Chatfield's building in shifts Monday, with Chatfield students attending classes in the morning and Columbine students in the afternoon. 

 Administrators asked friends of Harris and Klebold not to attend Chatfield, opting instead to have them home-schooled for the rest of the year. The parents agreed. 

 ``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 

 Davis put the number of students affected at eight to 10, but said he did not know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as the Trenchcoat Mafia. 

 Administrators banned trench coats at every school in Jefferson County, which has 89,000 students.
