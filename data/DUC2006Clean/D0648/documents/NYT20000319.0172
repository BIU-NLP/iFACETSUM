WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a major effort on Monday to reverse a sharp increase in the number of preschool children using Ritalin, Prozac and other powerful psychiatric drugs, administration officials said Sunday. 

 As part of the initiative, they said, the government will inform parents and teachers about the risks of such drugs, the Food and Drug Administration will develop new drug labels, the National Institutes of Health will begin a huge nationwide study of Ritalin use in children under the age of 6, and the White House will hold a conference this fall on the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness in very young children. 

 Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal health officials plan to meet on Monday with parents, psychiatrists, pediatricians, psychologists, nurses and social workers to discuss the issue. 

 Then the administration plans to issue a statement declaring that ``the use of medication is not generally the first option for a preschool child with a psychiatric disorder.'' 

 In a study last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers reported that there had apparently been a sharp increase in the number of preschoolers taking psychotropic drugs, particularly stimulants like Ritalin and antidepressants like Prozac. 

 The study caused concern among parents and medical experts alike, and the administration is now trying to address that concern. 

 In an interview, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, said, ``As a rule of thumb, doctors, psychologists and social workers should attempt to modify the behavior of a child and deal with family crises before drugs are prescribed.'' 

 The government has prepared a new guide for parents on the treatment of young children with mental disorders. ``When medication is used, it should not be the only strategy,'' but should be part of an overall treatment plan, the guide says. Parents and doctors may want to consider behavioral therapy for the child, family therapy and other techniques to help manage the child's symptoms, the document says. 

 Administration officials said the initiative was inspired mainly by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who they said wanted to announce some immediate steps after seeing the immense public concern about the use of powerful pills to treat toddlers with emotional and behavioral disorders. 

 Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate in New York, but White House officials said it would be cynical to believe that her motives were only political. They noted that for years she has been interested in children's issues, including the testing and labeling of drugs for children. Health officials and medical experts said the government's concern was well founded. 

 ``Everything Mrs. Clinton does is related to her campaign, but this initiative has substance too,'' a federal health official said. ``We want doctors and parents to think about these issues.'' 

 In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month, Dr. Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School, said that children with behavioral disorders were ``increasingly subjected to quick and inexpensive pharmacologic fixes,'' even though ``there is no empirical evidence to support psychotropic drug treatment in very young children.'' 

 Indeed, Ritalin carries a warning that says, ``Ritalin should not be used in children under 6 years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.'' 

 Hyman said that the National Institute of Mental Health would spend $6 million in the next five years to study whether Ritalin was safe and effective in treating preschoolers with the impulsive, aggressive behavior traits known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder _ the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in children. 

 In the study, Hyman said, hundreds of girls and boys at research centers around the country will receive Ritalin, behavior therapy or some combination of the two. 

 Hyman said that the problem was not simply that children were being overmedicated, but that they were not being appropriately evaluated and treated. ``In some communities,'' he said, ``too few children are receiving medications, just as in other communities, too many are getting medications.'' 

 Government scientists said that they recognized that drug therapy could sometimes provide relief to young children. ``If a kid is engaged in aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, head banging, and is otherwise uncontrollable, you should try medication,'' Hyman said. 

 Certain drugs are widely prescribed for young children even though they have not been studied, approved or labeled for such use. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine; after a drug is approved for one purpose, doctors often prescribe it for other purposes. 

 The White House said, for example, that some medications used to treat depression and anxiety disorders in children, like Paxil, Prozac and Wellbutrin, were not labeled for pediatric use. 

 In addition, the White House said, Zoloft has been approved to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 6 and older, while Luvox has been approved for the same condition in children 8 and older. But both drugs are used in younger children. 

 Drug labels often do not specify the proper doses for children. The White House said that the food and drug agency would soon specify how drug companies should conduct the research needed to develop ``pediatric dosage information'' that can be included on the labels of Ritalin, clonidine and other drugs used to treat hyperactivity and other attention deficit disorders in young children. 

 Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said that in the last year her agency had sent letters to seven companies asking them to study the effects of antidepressants in young people 7 to 18 years old. The government, she said, is analyzing ways in which research on younger children can be scientifically and ethically conducted. 

 Hyman said: ``Lots of mood disorders and anxiety disorders begin in childhood. But the younger a child is, the more difficult it is to make a diagnosis of mental disorder with certainty. It is quite difficult to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children under 6 because they are usually not articulate, their brains and behavior are changing rapidly, and they are very reactive to their environment.''
