Q. Do animals get bored?

 A. Yes, according to Dr. Nicholas Dodman of the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. 

 Scientists may not like to give it the human word ``boredom.'' But it is. The animals are finding something else to do when they aren't stimulated or can't do what they are programmed instinctively to do. 

 Dodman cites several examples. ``Horses have what are called `stall vices,' things they do when they're stuck in their stall for hours with nothing to do.'' 

 He says 25-35 percent of horses do something called cribbing, grasping a solid surface like their hay bucket or stall door in their teeth and pulling backwards on it. It causes air to move around in their throats making a gulping noise. 

 ``Some do it 600 times an hour,'' he says. 

 Others pace circles into their stall floor. Some dig with their hooves, sometimes holes up to their chests. 

 Dogs will chase their tails, chase shadows, leap into the air at imaginary insects, gnaw on furniture. Many dogs with nothing to do for hours will lick their paws excessively, causing sores called licking granuloma. Some dogs gulp at the air ``until they look inflated, like they ate a basketball,'' Dodman says. ``The air eventually comes out both ends.'' 

 Bored cats will eat, as in chew AND swallow, non-food items, like plastic shower curtains, running shoes, woolen objects. Bored Siamese cats are particularly known for a condition called ``wool sucking.'' 

 Dodman says monkeys in research facilities sometimes self-mutilate, picking at their own skin until it bleeds. Bored Macaque monkeys are known to do rectal probing. A gorilla at a local zoo was pulling out his hair and eating it, making himself vomit, behavior Dr. Dodman attributed to boredom. Polar bears in zoos pace. One at the Bronx Zoo did the backstroke excessively in its pool. A Russian bear at the San Diego zoo started drinking water out of its paw, something those animals don't normally do. 

 Common anti-depressant drugs like Prozac, also used to treat humans with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are sometimes given to bored animals that have OCD-like behavior. It cured those bears, Dr. Dodman said, and the gorilla, and prescribed properly can also help house pets that have adopted compulsive behaviors because of boredom.

 A couple of elementary corrections. A few weeks ago in a column we labeled Uranium ``Ur.'' The symbol is ``U.'' And we said the derivation of the name Hydrogen is from the Latin hudor, for water. Hudor is Greek. Aqua is Latin. Mea culpa is oops, we messed up.
