The United States is suffering from a veritable epidemic of mental illness, according to a report last week by the surgeon general, which asserted that ``22 percent of the population has a diagnosable mental disorder.'' 

 But how is mental illness defined? The standard reference used by therapists for diagnosis and for assigning insurance-payment codes is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. 

 The most recent edition, DSM-IV, which was issued in 1994, lists more than 300 kinds of mental disorders _ a far cry from the 22 illnesses identified in 1918 in the Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, the precursor to the DSM. 

 Like its predecessors, DSM-IV provides standardized diagnoses for debilitating mental illnesses like psychoses, major depressions, anxieties, phobias and personality disorders. But critics contend that the manual contains large gray areas in which ordinary life-adjustment problems and vexing behaviors are classified as mental illnesses requiring clinical treatment. 

 Here are some disorders found in those gray areas.

 &UR; Therapists and the courts have always struggled to separate mental illness from bad behavior. For example, a good percentage of any prison's criminal population would seem to fit the criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7): &LR; 

 1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors ... 

 2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure. 

 3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead. 

 4. Irritability and aggressiveness. 

 5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others. 

 6. Consistent irresponsibility ... 

 &UR; On the other hand, some behavior classified as mental illness seems to apply to quite functional, if annoying, people. How could Hollywood or Sunday morning television media-punditry thrive without personalities who exhibit the symptoms of Histrionic Personality Disorder (301.50)? &LR; 

 1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention. 

 2. Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior. 

 3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions. 

 4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self. 

 5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail. 

 6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality and exaggerated expression of emotion. 

 7. Is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances. 

 8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they really are. 

 &UR; Without doubt, psychiatric treatment is a life-saver for many deeply troubled children. But given the manual's broad definitions, many parents might question whether every adolescent is certifiable, at least on occasion. Consider the criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81): &LR; 

 1. Often loses temper. 

 2. Argues with adults. 

 3. Actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules. 

 4. Deliberately annoys people. 

 5. Blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior. 

 6. Is touchy or easily annoyed by others. 

 7. Is spiteful or vindictive. 

 &UR; Clinicians treating severe drug and alcohol addiction work within a wide range of diagnostic categories. The following also qualify as ``substance related disorders'': 

 Caffeine Intoxication (305.90): Recent consumption of caffeine in excess of 259 mg (e.g. more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee ...) 

 Nicotine Dependence Disorder (305.10): Tolerance to nicotine is manifested by the absence of nausea, dizziness and other characteristic symptoms .... 

 Nicotine Withdrawal Disorder 292.0: Abrupt cessation of nicotine use ((resulting in)) dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia; irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart-rate; increased appetite. &LR;

 Despite the comedy spin that Jack Nicholson put on it in the movie ``As Good as It Gets,'' obsessive-compulsive disorder can be debilitating. But the DSM's diagnostic criteria also suggest that the fretful workaholic with that desktop Snoopy figurine collection may require treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (301.4): 

 &UR; 1. Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost. 

 2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion ... 

 3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships ... 

 4. Is over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification). 

 5. Is unable to discard worn out or worthless objects ... &LR; 

 Many critics argue that the DSM often reflects political and cultural biases. For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness as recently as 1968 in DSM-II, which defined it as Sexual Deviation (302): 

 &UR; This category is for individuals whose sexual interests are directed primarily towards objects other than people of the opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus .... &LR; 

 The gay-rights movement ultimately pressured the American Psychiatric Association to eliminate homosexuality as a mental disorder in subsequent editions of the DSM. Cross-dressing males, however, are still categorized as mentally ill if they exhibit the signs of Transvestic Fetishism (302.3): 

 &UR; Over a period of at least 6 months in a heterosexual male, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing. &LR; 

 The manual suggests that additional clinical research be devoted to treatment for those who suffer from the symptoms of Identity Problem (313.82): 

 &UR; Uncertainty about multiple issues relating to identity, such as long-term goals, career choice, friendship patterns, sexual orientation and behavior, moral values and group loyalties. &LR; 

 Other diagnoses shift with the cultural climate. The latest DSM, for example, eliminated one controversial diagnosis that was previously applied to women suffering depression, Self-Defeating Personality Disorder (301.90): 

 &UR; 1. Chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure or mistreatment ... 

 2. Rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help him or her. 

 3. Following positive personal events (e.g., a new achievement), responds with depression ... 

 4. Incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt, defeated or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public ...). 

 5. Rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge enjoying himself or herself. ... 

 6. Fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal objectives. ... 

 7. Is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat him or her well ... 

 8. Engages in excessive self-sacrifice ... &LR; 

 The DSM suggests that denial can be itself be a symptom of a disorder called Non-Compliance with Treatment (V15.81): 

 &UR; The reasons for noncompliance may include discomfort resulting from treatment (e.g., medication side-effects); expense of treatment; decisions based on personal value judgments or religious or cultural beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed treatment; ((and)) maladaptive personality traits ... &LR;
