ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson will learn Wednesday whether he'll lose privileges and time off for good behavior for hurling a TV during an outburst in jail. 

 The former heavyweight champion faces a closed hearing at Montgomery County (Md.) Correction Center that day and a ruling will be announced then, the county's Department of Corrections said Monday. 

 Department spokesman Eric Seleznow said jail officials cited Tyson for destruction of property, assault on correctional staff and disorderly conduct. 

 A disciplinary panel will determine Tyson's level of responsibility. Penalties could include loss of privileges and credit for good behavior in time served. 

 The 32-year-old boxer has been in an isolation cell since Friday, when he tossed a television set against jail bars in an inmate recreation area. He reportedly became agitated when a guard hung up a telephone he was using. 

 ``Officials have three working days to have a hearing to consider all the facts relevant to the incident,'' Seleznow said. ``At this point, we're not considering criminal charges.'' 

 Jail officials Monday assessed Tyson's medical care, said a law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

 Tyson is serving a one-year sentence for assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in August in suburban Washington. 

 His jail outburst occurred two days after jail officials began withholding his daily dose of Zoloft, an antidepressant medication prescribed to manage what doctors have described as mood swings, a boxing source who requested anonymity told The Associated Press. 

 Doctors who testified at Tyson's licensing hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission in October said he is frequently depressed. 

 He is being treated by Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman of the psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical Center. The boxing source said Goldberg had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade jail officials to allow Tyson to continue his medication. 

 A Georgetown spokesman on Friday said Goldberg would not comment on the latest developments. 

 Zoloft is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of depression, panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Experts say abruptly withholding the medication from a patient would not lead to enhanced mood swings, but it could affect behavior. 

 ``One of the major rules in medicine is don't rock a stable boat,'' said Dr. John Greist, a clinical psychiatry professor at the Institute of Medicine in Madison, Wis. Greist, who began working with Zoloft three years before its FDA approval in 1991, has prescribed Zoloft for more than 200 patients. 

 He said that if Zoloft reduced irritability, anger and aggression, then ``discontinuing it gradually or abruptly would permit those inherent characteristics to reemerge.'' 

 Before last Wednesday, Tyson had taken Zoloft on a daily basis for four months with the exception of the week preceding his Jan. 16 fight with Francois Botha. A boxing source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he began taking it again the day after the fight. 

 Tyson won a fifth-round decision against Botha in his first since losing his boxing license for biting Evander Holyfield during a championship bout in June 1997. 

 While training for the Botha fight in Phoenix in December, Tyson appeared in good spirits. The week of the fight Tyson was combative at times, using profanity in one exchange with a television reporter. 

 Tyson is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. Indiana officials will consider whether to revoke his probation based on his legal problems in Maryland. 

 He pleaded no contest to the Maryland charges, but has until March 7 to appeal the sentence. 

 Tyson's advisers hoped he would be assigned to a prerelease program within 60 days. His assignment to a halfway house would have enabled him to resume his training, but this latest episode in jail could affect his eligibility for that program.
