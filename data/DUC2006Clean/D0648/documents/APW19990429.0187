Luvox, the medication Columbine High gunman Eric Harris was said to be taking, is an antidepressant commonly prescribed to treat obsessive-compulsive behavior. 

 The drug, known generically as fluvoxamine, boosts the brain's supply of a message-carrying chemical called serotonin and helps people lead normal lives without being plagued by unwanted, recurring thoughts and impulses. 

 Shortly before the attack, Harris, an 18-year-old senior, was rejected by the Marine Corps because he was taking Luvox, according to published reports. Investigators said they are interested in whether Harris' condition could be linked to the massacre. 

 Luvox requires several weeks to take effect, and remains in the body for several weeks after patients stop taking it. The drug can cause a variety of mild side effects, such as nervousness, dizziness and anxiety, but these are rare. 

 Victims of obsessive-compulsive behavior often feel compelled to perform the same task over and over, such as washing their hands or checking to make sure the door is locked. About 2 percent of adults have the disorder, and the first signs often appear in childhood.
