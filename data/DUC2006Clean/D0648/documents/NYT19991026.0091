LOS ANGELES _ People who are convinced some part of their body or face is repulsively ugly may find relief in a drug used to fight obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

 Victims of body dysmorphic disorder _ also known as ``imagined ugliness'' _ often seek multiple cosmetic surgeries, cover their face with makeup, wear wigs and hide at home feeling ashamed of their appearance. They also obsessively check mirrors and windows for their reflection, often upsetting themselves further. 

 In a study to be published in the November issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, researchers found that two-thirds of patients with the disorder responded to the drug clomipramine, which blocks the reabsorption of the brain chemical seratonin in cells. The drug is also used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder, from which many victims also suffer. 

 A surprising number of sufferers _ 60 percent in the latest study _ are men, said Eric Hollander of Mount Sinai Medical Center, co-author of the research. He presented the results Monday at the American Medical Association's Science Reporters Conference at the University of California at Los Angeles. 

 In one case, a man believed his penis was being retracted into his body and had surgery to detach some of the muscles in his groin. 

 Another man, a lawyer, worked as a messenger because he was too afraid of being in situations that might bring attention to himself. 

 One in four people with the disorder will attempt suicide, Hollander said, and most are single because they can't enter into or sustain relationships. 

 Still, until fairly recently it has ``been regarded as a rare and trivial disease,'' when, in fact, it affects as much as 1 to 2 percent of the population, Hollander said. Body dysmorphic disorder became a diagnosis only 12 years ago. 

 Hollander believes many people diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and social phobia actually suffer from BDD but are too ashamed to admit it. 

 And the relentless bombardment in modern society of images of perfect bodies may set up conditions that trigger the disorder more easily. 

 ``There are a lot of unrealistic images out there, both of men and women,'' Hollander said. 

 Plastic surgeons are becoming increasingly aware and wary of patients with BDD. Sufferers are usually unhappy with the results of cosmetic procedures, often suing or even attacking their surgeons. Many doctors try to screen patients for the disorder before agreeing to treat them. 

 Still, Hollander said, one patient underwent a whopping 23 surgeries in the quest for the perfect face and body. 

 The disorder usually begins in adolescence, but there have been some cases where it appeared as early as age 5. 

 Hollander and colleagues in Rhode Island and Cincinnati are currently recruiting teen-age sufferers for trials of another drug, fluorextine, also used for obsessive compulsive disorder. 

 It has fewer side effects than clomipramine, which has been known to cause dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation.
