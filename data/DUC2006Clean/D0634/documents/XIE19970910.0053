OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of British Columbia (B.C.) has launched its lawsuit against the United States for failing to curb overfishing by Alaska and other states in the Pacific Northwest. 

 The Canadian province plans to seek 325 million dollars (230 million US dollars) in damages for alleged U.S. overfishing, said reports today. 

 "This is not about an attempt to get money for American overfishing," B.C. Premier Glen Clark was quoted as saying. 

 "This is about using the American court system to force the states to comply with the principles of salmon treaty, conserve the resource and force them to get back to the table and negotiate a treaty in both our interests." 

 The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty. 

 The U.S. federal government signed the treaty in 1985 and remains responsible for enforcing it in individual states. 

 Apart from the damages, the suit also seeks a court order certifying that the U.S. violated its international obligations, and directing Washington to compel compliance by individual states. 

 The B.C. latest move reinvigorates the Pacific fish war that has raged between Canada and the U.S. for months. 

 Yet, a memo leaked later Monday in Ottawa casts doubt on the province's chance of success. 

 The memo, prepared by Canada's federal government, concludes that a U.S. court would not likely side with Canadian interests in such a dispute. 

 Ottawa said it had considered its own lawsuit, but ruled out the option for various reasons including an interest in focusing on diplomacy.
