WASHINGTON _ One hundred years ago this year, a Smithsonian Institution biologist visited the Pacific Northwest and marveled at the plentifulness of the fish that has come to symbolize the region. 

 ``The quantities of salmon which frequent these waters is beyond calculation,'' said Richard Rathbun, ``and seems to be so great as to challenge human ingenuity to affect it in any way.'' 

 But over the last century, human ingenuity in the form of homebuilding, logging, farming, dam-building, fishing and other activities has managed to significantly affect those very same salmon runs of which Rathbun spoke. 

 Tuesday, in an attempt to reverse the course of history, the federal government plans to formally announce that nine salmon and steelhead groupings in Washington and Oregon are headed for extinction. 

 The dwindling salmon runs are throughout the Northwest, from Ozette Lake on the Olympic Peninsula to the Columbia, Snake and Willamette rivers. By the end of the day Tuesday, virtually every watershed in Washington state will be subject to the strictures of the federal Endangered Species Act, which makes it a crime to harm endangered and threatened species. 

 And there is more to come. In June, another federal agency plans to list coastal Puget Sound bull trout _ another type of salmon _ for protection. 

 But much of the focus will be on the wild Puget Sound chinook, prized by fishermen for their large size, but now numbering about one-third of their historic peak. The chinook spend part of their life cycle in rivers and streams that extend throughout the same part of the Northwest most densely populated by human beings _ the central Puget Sound counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish, home to 3 million people. 

 The listing of four groups of chinook as threatened _ meaning they are at risk of becoming endangered _ will post a major test of just how far this country is willing to go in protecting endangered species. 

 There are currently 702 species of plants and 477 species of animals listed for protection under the 26-year-old Endangered Species Act. But most of those species live in sparsely populated rural areas. Never before has the government demanded protection of a species whose habitat so completely suffuses one of the nation's large metropolitan areas. 

 By declaring the species eligible for protection under the federal Endangered Species Act, the government will be calling for changes in a wide variety of practices by farmers, fishermen, builders, businesses and homeowners. These groups are thought to be harming the salmon either directly, by catching them or blocking their passage, or indirectly, by polluting or altering the waters the fish call home. 

 ``We've got problems with water quality and water quantity in many parts of the state, habitat destruction from agriculture and timber and development, hydropower and harvest and hatchery impacts,'' says Curt Smitch, salmon adviser to Gov. Gary Locke. Smitch says changes could be required in all of those areas. 

 Of the nine species to be listed for protection Tuesday, seven are in Washington state, and two are in Oregon. The National Marine Fisheries Services has decided to postpone for six months decisions on whether to list for protection four other species in California and Oregon. 

 ``The basic message of the listings is that salmon and the need to recover salmon has landed squarely in the urban areas of the Northwest, and not just the countryside,'' said Bill Bradbury, executive director of the Oregon-based group For the Sake of the Salmon, a coalition of governments, industry and environmental groups working to conserve salmon. ``That was already true, or becoming true, in Portland, but clearly with major listings in the Puget Sound, salmon have come to the city.'' 

 The effect of the announcement will be gradual _ at first, only federal actions will be affected, and it will take some months before federal agenciesspell out the rules that place new restrictions on activities on state and private lands. 

 State and local governments hope to retain a large degree of control over salmon conservation measures, but ultimately, the federal government and any activist can ask the courts to force an end to behavior that harms the threatened species. 

 By the beginning of next year, the changes are likely to affect many of the residents and businesses of the central Puget Sound. 

 Homebuilding will be more difficult along the region's many waterways. Disposal of agricultural and industrial waste will be more closely scrutinized. The already sharply-restricted commercial and sport fisheries in Puget Sound may be even more restricted. Small dams could be bypassed or removed. Homeowners may be asked to pay higher fees for stormwater storage and treatment. 

 ``Clearly, there is going to be some pain involved in this,'' said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service. ``We're not going to go back to the middle of the 19th Century, but we're not going to ignore the fact that critical, vital salmon habitat has been destroyed and is being destroyed, and...that's going to be a violation of law.'' 

 Government officials are hoping they can protect the salmon without choking off the region's remarkable economic growth. 

 ``I see this as a challenge to grow much more wisely, in a smarter fashion than ever before,'' said Gov. Gary Locke. 

 The diet of Northwesterners, however, is not likely to be impacted. Most salmon sold in area supermarkets is either caught wild in Alaska or is raised in pens in Canada, Chile and the United States. 

 The Pacific Northwest has grappled with the Endangered Species Act before. The listing of the northern spotted owl for protection in 1990 caused tremendous bitterness in the region, pitting environmentalists against timber communities and ultimately helping to spur unsuccessful efforts to overturn the law. 

 Then in 1996, Oregon began a costly and failed battle to prevent the federal government from listing coastal coho for protection. 

 But Tuesday's listings, which will remain in place until the salmon runs recover, are dramatically different. Conservatives in Congress have given up any effort to weaken the Endangered Species Act, and local officials aren't even considering mounting a challenge to the declaration that salmon are threatened. 

 Salmon _ because of their iconic status in the Northwest _ seem to enjoy greater public sympathy than the rarely seen owl. And although the salmon listing is likely to affect more people than the spotted owl listing, the effect is likely to be more diffused, with few communities suffering the sharp economic damage experienced by logging towns a decade ago. 

 A poll taken last summer by Elway Research found that most residents are willing to spend money to save salmon, and most do not believe a listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act will directly affect their lives. 

 Some argue that there is public sympathy for the salmon because their plight, in some ways, echoes the plight of human residents of the area. 

 ``People in this region are tired of the direction we're going, as far as quality of life,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington Environmental Alliance for Voter Education. ``The salmon are an indicator of environmental problems we're having in the Northwest...Whether it's sitting in traffic, the loss of open spaces, declining drinking water -- this is kind of a wake-up call.'' 

 But ultimately, the Endangered Species Act aims to protect the endangered animals. It is likely to be decades before anyone really knows whether the measures forced by Tuesday's listing which actually lead to restoration of the salmon runs. 

 ``There's nothing new here _ we have been worried about the decline of salmon and trying to do something about it for over a century, but we keep trying the same kinds of things the same ways,'' said James Karr, a professor of fisheries and zoology at the University of Washington. 

 ``This announcement is going to cause a lot of activity, but sadly, a substantial portion of that activity will be wheelspinning unrelated to restoring salmon, and as a society we should be up in arms about that because it's our resources that are being wasted.'' 

 But others are more optimistic. 

 ``A very large number of these runs are going to be brought back to vitality,'' said Denis Hayes, a leading environmental advocate and president of the Bullitt Foundation. ``I am enough of a realist not to believe they all will, but this is a region that from the governor to the clerk in the grocery store shares an objective to make this happen...We'll just pull up our boots and get to it.''
