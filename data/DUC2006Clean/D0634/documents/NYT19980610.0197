PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Look beyond the hype over the deal to save the Headwaters Forest and you'll see that taxpayers may not be getting their money's worth. 

 Soon the California Legislature will decide whether to appropriate $130 million for purchase of 7,500 acres of redwoods in Humboldt County. With an additional $250 million in federal money, the purchase price of these majestic trees is $380 million. 

 In my view, the 7,500 acres of virgin and second-growth redwoods are not by themselves worth $380 million. This huge expenditure is justified only if the public can be assured that the side agreement _ a giant string attached to the purchase, known as a ``habitat conservation plan'' _ won't imperil the future of endangered species on the rest of Pacific Lumber's 200,000 acres nearby. 

 As it stands now, the habitat conservation plan negotiated by Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the logging of ancient redwoods. It could also lead to extinction of the coho salmon population in California. 

 In March, the Legislature's Joint Committee on Headwaters Forest, which I co-chair with Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, uncovered the following: 

 The proposed Headwaters habitat conservation plan may not preserve the other 12 groves of ancient redwoods owned by Pacific Lumber. Contrary to the ``50-year protection'' allegedly locked in for these groves, Pacific Lumber is negotiating a separate side agreement with federal wildlife officials that would allow the company to seek changes to the habitat plan periodically for the purpose of logging one or more of these groves. 

 The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers. In 1973, there were 40,000 fishing jobs on the North Coast. Now there are just 5,000. Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining destroyed the coho salmon's habitat. 

 Under the proposed Headwaters habitat plan, Pacific Lumber would establish a 30-foot ``no-cut'' zone on the sides of streams to protect spawning habitat for coho salmon. Yet two of the U.S. Forest Service's top coho salmon experts _ geologist Leslie Reid and hydrologist Robert Ziemer _ have asserted that the ``no-cut'' buffer zones are inadequate. The scientists noted ``significant discrepancy'' between the protections in the Headwaters habitat conservation plan and the two most widely accepted, scientifically based sources, which recommend ``no-cut'' zones of 170 to 300 feet. 

 To date, officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency responsible for survival of the coho salmon, have been unable to rationalize the inconsistency between the previously recommended national standards of 170- to 300-foot ``no-cut'' zones and the Headwaters plan, which requires only 30 feet. 

 To be sure, politics is the art of compromise. Wildlife biology, however, is not. If we compromise the habitat of the coho salmon for Pacific Lumber, we will be forced to do so for other private landowners up and down the coast. 

 Although the struggle for Headwaters Forest has already gone on for more than 15 years, we must remember that extinction is forever. 

 Stepping back to rethink the Headwaters agreement will be a prudent step. We must ensure that the Headwaters deal does what it ought to do: Strengthen rather than weaken environmental protection.
