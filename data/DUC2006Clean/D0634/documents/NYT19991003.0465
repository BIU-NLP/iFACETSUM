LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash. _ The big hydroelectric dam sits deep in a valley framed by softly rounded, grass-covered mountains that look from a distance as if they have been sanded down and then covered with beige and blond velvet. 

 Great expanses of sun-dappled blue water, more reservoir or lake than river, stretch above and below the concrete-and-earth barrier. That is part of the problem. 

 The once fast-flowing Snake River is now so slow, and Lower Granite Dam so much of an impediment, that salmon _ totem fish of the Pacific Northwest and the focus of a landmark political, economic and environmental struggle _ cannot migrate up and down the Snake without the help of an elaborate man-made Rube Goldberg-like system. 

 So it was on a recent day as a state fisheries biologist, Fred Mensik, plucked a silvery, six-inch fish from water speeding through a trough. 

 ``Chinook,'' Mensik said, identifying it as a member of the heftiest of the salmon species. If it lives long enough, the juvenile smolt, as it is called, could grow to 3 or 4 feet and 40 pounds or more. 

 Mensik measured the fish, entered the information into a laptop computer and returned the fish to the trough, where it joined other smolts and migrating young steelhead (sea-run rainbow trout) on their way to a tank truck parked outside. 

 The truck would transport the juvenile fish nearly 250 miles downriver, past seven other dams in the Columbia River system, of which the Snake is a part. There the fish were released to resume a trip to the Pacific Ocean. 

 While Mensik and his co-workers were shepherding the fish downstream, adult salmon and steelhead _ big, powerful veterans of years at sea _ were climbing a fish ladder a few feet away, heading upstream to spawn and die. 

 But there are so few going back upstream that all these fish, along with all other salmon and steelhead that spawn in the Snake River, are listed as imperiled under the Endangered Species Act. 

 Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon? The question is at the heart of a tense debate over whether to continue to rely on the transportation system or junk it and remove the earthen portions of Lower Granite and three other hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake. 

 Breaching the dams would help restore the natural flow along a 140-mile stretch of the river, and many scientists say it would be the single most effective remedy for the salmon's plight. The concrete portions of the dams, their humming turbines silenced, would become relics; abandoned monuments to a time when the only consideration was to conquer and harness nature, and to the dawn of an era in which coexisting with nature has been made a priority. 

 A decision on the dams, driven by a federal lawsuit brought by environmentalists, was expected by early next year. If the Clinton administration proposes breaching the dams, the issue would then go to Congress, which must appropriate the money. 

 Few if any conservation problems match this one for scale and complexity, or for its many connections with the modern economy. ``The salmon involves our whole way of doing things,'' said Dr. Peter M. Kareiva, an ecologist who is directing a scientific assessment of the problem for the National Marine Fisheries Service. ``There is no simple, easily defined enemy.'' 

 Many scientists and environmentalists say the question of whether to breach the dams is a no-brainer. They argue that the population of the Snake River salmon began to decline after the dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and that while the system for trucking and barging fish downstream and helping adults back up may have helped, it is inadequate. 

 ``Prior to completion of the lower Snake River dams, Snake River stocks did as well or better than their downriver counterparts,'' said Ed Bowles, a scientist who is the salmon and steelhead recovery manager for the state of Idaho, which contains the Snake's watershed upstream of the four dams. ``Since completion of the dams, we have every year done much worse.'' 

 But other scientists, particularly those of the marine fisheries service, say the situation is more complicated. The service's studies, which are being reviewed by an independent panel, suggest that while breaching the dams may be necessary to save some salmon stocks, it will not be enough. 

 The wild salmon population has also been hurt by the destruction and degradation of spawning areas, overfishing and the introduction of hatchery-bred salmon and trout, according to the analysis. (Only about 20 percent of Snake River salmon today are the progeny of wild fish.) 

 Unless these problems are solved, the analysis suggested, the wild salmon and trout will probably continue to decline, even if the dams are breached. 

 Breaching ``is not going to be a silver bullet,'' said Dr. Michelle McClure, a biologist with the fisheries service who is helping to conduct the federal analysis. 

 Moreover, said the fisheries service, which will draft the scientific opinion on which the decision about the dams will be based, the latest evidence suggests that trucking and barging young fish is more effective than was previously thought. Whether that is true should become clear in 5 or 10 years, scientists with the fisheries service said. 

 One option, they said, would be to wait. But other experts, including Bowles, said the answer was as apparent now as it would ever be. The fisheries service said any delay would increase the likelihood that some stocks of Snake River salmon would become extinct. 

 Pacific salmon are different from Atlantic salmon in that there are several species, and that different populations spawn at different times. Moreover, they spawn only once and then die (Atlantic salmon, and steelhead, can return to the ocean and spawn again, several times). 

 Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
