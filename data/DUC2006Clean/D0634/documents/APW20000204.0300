WASHINGTON (AP) -- A permanent conservation fund that President Clinton will propose Monday includes $100 million for initiatives to preserve salmon in four West Coast states, officials said. 

 If Clinton gets his way, the money to save salmon in Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California would be replenished automatically at $100 million each year for at least a decade. 

 The money would go to the states annually without approval from Congress -- if Congress agrees to enact Clinton's ``Lands Legacy'' program into law this year. 

 ``The fact that we've come back and asked for the full $100 million, and this year proposed in addition that it be made permanent, shows how serious we are about making this a priority,'' said George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. 

 In all, Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest. 

 That includes $91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system; $60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada; and $39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts. 

 The proposals represent increases of 30 percent or more over what Congress approved last year for salmon. 

 Salmon are a cultural icon on the Pacific Northwest and have been suffering for decades from dams, development, overfishing, runoff and other problems. 

 In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 26 salmon populations are threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. 

 Clinton first proposed the $100 million to help rebuild coastal salmon stocks a year ago, but Congress approved just $58 million for the effort. 

 Frampton declined to discuss other details of the ``Lands Legacy'' proposal until the administration reveals its fiscal 2001 budget on Monday. But he said the program will use off-shore oil drilling royalties and other revenues to create a permanent, dedicated fund for environmental preservation. 

 The House Resources Committee last November approved a bill that is similar to what the administration is proposing. The measure would set aside more than 60 percent of off-shore oil drilling revenues for buying land and conserving coastline. But that measure, which is pending on the House floor, did not single out salmon for funding.
