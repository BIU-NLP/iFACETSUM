OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. refusal to honor the Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60 million dollars (42 million U.S. dollars) a year, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson. 

 The U.S. overfishing undermined Canadian efforts to save the salmon from extinction, the minister was quoted by Thursday's Globe and Mail newspaper as saying. 

 "Americans are taking more of our fish than we are taking of theirs, and the trend is upward," Anderson said in a speech on the eve of a long-delayed resumption of talks on salmon quotas. 

 Ottawa and Washington announced Tuesday that the talks will begin at the end of this month, three months after two special envoys urged immediate return to negotiations. 

 The envoys also asked the Alaskan fishermen to reduce their interception of Canadian-bound fish in the North Pacific. 

 Under the 1985 treaty, neither country is supposed to take more fish from the ocean than the number that originates in their waters. 

 Yet, Alaskan interceptions of fish returning to Canadian rivers last year reached an unprecedented peak, even while Canada was cutting its own catch to save them from extinction, Anderson noted. 

 In the south, Canada has also cut its interception of fish swimming into U.S. waters off Washington state, and helped that state's conservation programs, he added.
