OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States announced here Thursday that they have reached an agreement on the elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific salmon. 

 The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of their salmon industries, said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday. 

 The comprehensive agreement, reached through vigorous diplomacy among the responsible parties, is designed to ensure the sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a combination of scientific co-operation, in addition to providing new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of weakened salmon stocks. The agreement is also necessary to limit on salmon catches, said the joint statement. 

 Under the accord, the U.S. will provide 142 million U.S. dollars to a conservation fund to help rebuild stocks and habitat on both sides of the border. 

 It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson. 

 The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited under 16. 5 percent, down from an historical average of about 20 percent, while U.S. fishermen took 25 percent last year. 

 The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based on how many fish were spawned in each country. 

 However, sections that dictated how to do that expired in 1992. Since then, there have been a series of failed and sometimes hostile negotiations for a new agreement.
