SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its first report. 

 ``Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among the lowest of the last 50 years. We seem to have gone from many diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs,'' said John Fraser, the council's chairman and former speaker of Canada's House of Commons. 

 The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest. 

 The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast, Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000 fish to fewer than 25,000. 

 The report released Tuesday said that coho salmon are in danger from the Skeena River, in northern British Columbia, south to Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia. Last year, Canada curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon. 

 But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Fraser River, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast. 

 ``The central coast area once supported the second largest sockeye fishery in British Columbia, after the Fraser. The Rivers and Smith Inlet fisheries are now essentially closed,'' said the Council report. 

 The Council is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed last September to advise Canada's fisheries minister David Anderson on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs. 

 Its report comes less than a week after the United States and Canada reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing salmon runs from the Alaska border to the Oregon coast. 

 The Council said Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs. 

 ``For example, there is a shortfall in basic (counting) and assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks, primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and protection,'' the report said. 

 The report noted that fisheries officials cannot account for what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the Fraser River last year but never reached their spawning grounds. 

 ``The state of many salmon stocks is unknown,'' the panel reported. ``The Council has found that there are such glaring information gaps ... that no valid conclusions could be drawn about the state of many stocks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that salmon biodiversity is being eroded.'' 

 The 1998 salmon catch along Canada's west coast was about half the average catch of the last half-century, the Council reported. 

 ``It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the reduced catch,'' it found. 

 The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian government and British Columbia provincial government, which have bitterly feuded over fisheries policy. 

 Anderson on Wednesday defended his department, saying it spends $220 million (Canadian) in the Pacific region and has invested major work on restoring salmon habitat. 

 But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing restoration fall under the control of the British Columbia government, noted Sharon Chow of the Sierra Club of British Columbia, which endorsed the Council report. 

 ``We still have a huge problem between the province and the federal government, and between Anderson and (British Columbia Premier) Glen Clark,'' she added. ``And that is not good for fish.'' 

 Fraser noted, however, that the United States and Canada have managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute. 

 ``We have created some stability and set out in the direction of much closer Canada-U.S. cooperation to save fish,'' he said. ``Now it is time to get our own house in order.'' 

 In a future report, the Council is expected to discuss breakdowns in Canada's fisheries enforcement, particularly overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once salmon have begun their upstream migration.
