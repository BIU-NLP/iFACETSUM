 The decline of the once-great salmon populations off the Pacific coasts of Canada and the United States ranks high on the list of the 20th century's environmental disasters. But 1999 may well turn out to be the year when the fish finally caught a break. In March, acting under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government set in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs throughout the Pacific Northwest. Then last week, following years of fruitless negotiations, the United States and Canada announced a plan to set new limits on salmon catches and establish a conservation fund to further protect the fish. 

 At the core of the complex agreement are new protections for ``intercepted'' salmon stocks _ fish that spawn in one country but are caught as they migrate through another country's waters. Under the old rules, fishermen in, say, Alaska or British Columbia were allowed to catch a fixed number of fish every year, regardless of the health of the fish population. Under the new agreement, harvest levels would be adjusted up or down based on scientific measurements of fish stocks along thousands of miles of coastline. The agreement also calls for a $140 million fund that would be used to buy up fishing licenses _ essentially paying some fishermen not to fish _ and to begin restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning areas have been damaged. 

 The importance of this agreement is that it finally addresses the demand side of the salmon equation. The supply of fish can be increased if the rivers where they spawn are restored to good health. But these efforts will mean little if the fish continue to be over-harvested at sea. The agreement is also heartening in another sense. As David Anderson, the Canadian fisheries minister, once observed, ``if two friendly neighbors can't agree on this issue, what does that forecast for diplomacy elsewhere?'' Anderson deserves much credit for this deal, along with Gov. Tony Knowles of Alaska _ who agreed to subject Alaska's profitable annual harvest to the new rules _ and Trout Unlimited, a private organization that suggested key provisions. 

 Vice President Gore played a role, too, which cannot hurt his environmental credentials. But he has more to do. Money must still be secured from a Republican Congress for the United States' share of the $140 million restoration program, as well as for a separate $100 million fund _ a special favorite of Gore's _ to help the Pacific Northwest clean up rivers and streams. Beyond that, the Administration will face a politically risky decision later this year about whether to dismantle four hydropower dams on the Snake River, which over the years have had a calamitous effect on salmon stocks. That decision will tell a lot about how serious this Administration is about the salmon.
