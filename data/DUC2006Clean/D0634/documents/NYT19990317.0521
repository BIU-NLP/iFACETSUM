The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 18: 

 The federal government's decision on Tuesday to order new protections for nine threatened salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest is just the beginning of what could be the biggest and most expensive rescue effort in the 26-year history of the Endangered Species Act. It is an effort worth making. 

 The decline of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the name of economic growth. The time has surely come to correct that mistake. 

 What makes the challenge uniquely interesting is its reach. Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to save them will have to be regional in scope. The effort will inevitably require higher taxes to clean hundreds of waterways and buy open space in crucial watersheds. It will impose tough restrictions on new construction, farming and logging, and may even require the costly decommissioning of federal and private dams that impede salmon runs but have also long supplied the Pacific Northwest with cheap power. The early response from local politicians and citizens has been extraordinarily positive. One reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon. Beyond that, many local residents are consumed by fears that development will someday destroy the natural beauty that surrounds them. 

 A save-the-salmon effort, with all the restrictions that implies, is thus seen as a timely antidote to shapeless sprawl. As Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, noted, ``as we work to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us.'' 

 But this battle has a very long way to go. It is one thing to preach salvation. It is quite another to pay the price when the controls kick in _ when farmers have to stop using pesticides, when developers have to stop building in sensitive watersheds, when loggers have to stop cutting trees along salmon-bearing streams. Today's euphoria could easily become tomorrow's backlash. 

 There are also many questions surrounding the federal commitment. Washington moved to protect the salmon only because environmental advocacy groups threatened to sue if it did not _ an exact replay of the campaign to save the spotted owl. By listing the salmon as threatened, the Clinton administration has now saddled itself with an even more onerous responsibility _ insuring that Washington and Oregon develop an effective plan to save the fish. Vice President Al Gore has promised a special appropriation of $100 million to underwrite a ``cooperative restoration effort.'' 

 But if the states falter, Washington would be obliged under the Endangered Species Act to step in with a variety of legal and regulatory weapons that, in effect, could halt development in its tracks. 

 An early test of this commitment will come in the next few months when the administration delivers its long-awaited proposal for restoring several species of salmon in the Snake River that were listed as endangered or threatened back in 1991 and 1992. Some scientists believe that these species will never recover unless the federal government dismantles or at least modifies eight dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers _ a strategy unalterably opposed by many big consumers of electricity and by Washington's powerful Republican senator, Slade Gorton. 

 The administration may find other ways to restore the fresh-water flows essential to the salmon's survival. But what matters here is the end result _ recovery. How the administration responds will tell much about its long-term dedication to the other species listed this week.
