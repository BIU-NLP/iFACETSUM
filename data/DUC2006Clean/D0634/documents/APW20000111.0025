WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal salmon proposal unveiled last month was supposed to be good news for loggers, developers and other industries in four states. 

 The plan offers exemptions from new federal salmon regulations, as long as the industries abide by certain state and local rules in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. 

 But some business leaders see big problems instead of a great deal. 

 The same proposal that carves out exemptions also says people who kill, harm or harass 14 threatened salmon populations or their habitat could face one year in jail and a $50,000 fine. 

 Business owners who have grown used to the idea of land restrictions because of salmon problems say the prospect of stiff penalties -- even for indirectly hurting the fish -- is going too far. 

 "Northwesterners are now at the mercy of federal officials, accountable to no one, and many northwesterners will dare not offend them," James Buchal, a Portland, Ore., attorney who represents businesses on salmon issues, wrote in a critique of the plan. 

 The proposal announced Dec. 14 will indeed result in more endangered species prosecutions, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. 

 But the prosecutions will be limited and targeted at the most egregious violators who destroy salmon habitat, dump toxic chemicals in rivers and apply pesticides so that they harm streams, agency officials said. 

 The Fisheries Service has neither the staff nor desire to aggressively track down all violators across the 159,000 square miles the plan covers, they said. 

 But the new proposal signals that the agency is serious about recovering the fish, said Garth Griffin, a fisheries service biologist in Portland. 

 "If something is listed, it's serious," Griffin said. "It has the possibility of sometime going extinct." 

 Under the Endangered Species Act, people who harm any of the nation's 934 endangered species -- plants and animals in danger of becoming extinct -- could face jail time or fines. 

 Under most circumstances, people who do the damage are not exempt from possible penalties unless they get a federal permit allowing them to "take," or harm a species. 

 But the ESA does not extend the penalties to 263 threatened species, including many of the listed salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. (Threatened species are defined as likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.) 

 In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 20 of the 26 salmon populations listed under the ESA are threatened. The other six are endangered. 

 The Fish and Wildlife Service, the federal agency primarily responsible for enforcing the ESA, wrote regulations that make penalties identical for threatened and endangered species. But the Fisheries Service, which enforces the ESA for salmon, has no such regulations. 

 Instead the agency decides when crafting rules for individual listings whether harming a threatened species should carry ESA penalties. 

 The Fisheries Service's announcement on Dec. 14 was the first indication that the agency intends to require penalties under new rules for 14 threatened salmon stocks. 

 "That's clearly a concern," said Laura Cleland of the Independent Forest Products Association in Portland, saying some landowners worry about being targeted by the agency. 

 But Griffin said the Fisheries Service's decision should not have been a surprise. The agency calls for penalties in most rules it promulgates for threatened species, he said. 

 If the newly proposed rules are adopted, harming 24 of the 26 salmon populations in the four states could result in a penalty. 

 The Fisheries Service has not yet drafted rules for the other two populations because they were listed in September. 

 Still, Fisheries Service prosecutions for ESA violations have been rare in the Pacific Northwest. 

 The agency brought just 19 cases against alleged endangered species violators in the region in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That was down from 23 prosecutions in 1998. 

 Environmentalists say landowners probably don't have much to worry about in terms of Fisheries Service enforcement under the new rules. 

 While the rules call for penalties, the Fisheries Service has not specifically said which activities -- such as logging too close to a stream, or dumping fertilizer into a stream -- will most quickly draw prosecutions. 

 That has caused confusion, said Daniel Hall, director of the forest biodiversity program at American Lands Alliance in Portland. 

 The agency "is telling landowners to be scared, but they're not telling them what to be scared of," Hall said. 

 Meanwhile, the Fisheries Service plans 22 hearings on the proposed rules, which begin Jan. 10 in Portland and run through Feb. 3 in San Luis Obispo, Calif. 

 The rules could become final in June 2000.
