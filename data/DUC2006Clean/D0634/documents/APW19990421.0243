WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heard of crash test dummies? Now there's a crash test salmon. 

 Engineers on Wednesday unveiled Flubber, a six-inch rubbery replica of a young salmon packed with wires and sensors. 

 The fake fish will spurt through the churning, 10-foot-long blades of the McNary hydropower dam on the Washington-Oregon border next month to measure how salmon are jostled, scraped and even killed on their treacherous journey downstream. 

 ``The idea is to document with data what fish experience,'' said George Hecker, president of Alden Research Laboratory Inc. in Holden, Mass. 

 The synthetic salmon was developed at the Department of Energy's Richland, Wash., lab as part of a five-year, $8 million government effort to make hydropower dams more fish friendly. 

 Government scientists and some corporate partners, including Alden and Voith Hydro Power Generation of York, Pa., want to use the Flubber data and studies of real salmon to make better turbines. 

 So far, the faux fish seems up to the job. It has been tested with a sledgehammer, a lighted candle and intense water pressure, said Bennie Rinehart, an engineer with Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Co., which helped finance the project. 

 ``Everything is working real good,'' he said. 

 Industry experts say 90 percent of the fish that pass through a dam turbine survives. But with many salmon forced to go through and around eight large dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers, the overall survival rate can be as low as 60 percent. 

 By changing the turbines' shape, the survival rate at a dam could rise to 98 percent, said Diane Lear, a Voith Hydro administrator. 

 In the Pacific Northwest, 16 salmon species are considered threatened or endangered, and Congress has authorized more than $100 million a year on attempts to bring them back. Environmentalists consider most of these attempts expensive failures and are pushing for the partial removal of four Snake River dams. 

 But even a harsh critic of government salmon efforts, Justin Hayes of American Rivers, said it may have something useful in Flubber.
