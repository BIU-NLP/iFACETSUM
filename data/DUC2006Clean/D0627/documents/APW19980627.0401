MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin Saturday signed a revised adoption law that would tighten control over foreign adoptions and encourage more Russians to adopt children. The amendments to Russia's adoption law were approved by the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, on June 5 and passed by the upper house, the Federation Council, on June 10. The Kremlin press office said Yeltsin signed the amendments to the law to give the state more control over adoptions and ``to insure the rights and interests of children in adoptions.'' The original version of the law introduced in parliament earlier in the year said that Russia must sign agreements with other countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept. 1, 1999. The amended version of the bill contained no time limit for the prospective international agreements to be signed, meaning pending adoptions will not be stalled by the measure. The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out the rules. In the interim, prospective foreign parents can use the services of proxies as they do now. According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia, usually through Russian intermediaries. (jai)
