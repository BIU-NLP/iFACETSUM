CHESTER, Vt. _ Rocking her granddaughter to sleep, Jayne Gallagher could hear the raspy, televised voice of Vermont's governor above the infant's soft breathing: ``Vermont has long been known as the least diverse state in the nation. That is rapidly changing.'' 

 Governor Howard Dean's words last year, part of a plea for enlightened attitudes after several race-related incidents, must have stirred something in Gallagher, who is white, because soon she was overseeing an unusual merger of two very different worlds _ one white and rural, the other African and war-torn. 

 From the small town of Chester, where residents can drive along country roads all their lives without encountering a black person, Gallagher started the Ethiopian Adoption Project. Dozens of families from across the whitest state in the nation have agreed to adopt 60 children orphaned by Ethiopia's war with neighboring Eritrea. Gallagher expects the first group of children to begin arriving in Vermont by December. 

 ``I thought: What a loving way to diversify Vermont,'' Gallagher said. 

 Her mission of mercy, though, has rekindled an emotional debate over whether children are hurt when they are adopted across racial and cultural lines. To Gallagher, it matters only that the children, who have seen their parents die in what is being dubbed as the world's bloodiest war, have a home and love. 

 But Rudolph Smith, president of the Association of Black Social Workers, fears that Ethiopians being brought to live in a culture as white as Vermont will be stripped of their self-identity. ``Ethiopia is an African culture with black Africans, and Vermont is a lily, lily white state,'' he said. ``You are going to have a whole bunch of black children running around who don't know who they are.'' 

 Vermont's black population of an estimated 3,102 in 1997, which has never tipped over 1 percent, could easily fit in Boston University's Walter Brown Arena with room to spare. But as the state experiences a small but noticeable increase of black and Asian residents within the past decade, it has also begun to grapple with race-related issues. 

 ``It won't be easy,'' said Joe Kroll, whose adopted Korean daughter Mei Lin, now 22, gives speeches on how hard it was to grow up in a white world and retain her self-identity. 

 Kroll, executive director of the North American Council of Adoptable Children, based in St. Paul, said Vermont parents will struggle with protecting their children and teaching them to embrace their own culture. ``The sign of a successful interracial placement is if the child has a strong and healthy self-esteem and identity toward their own culture or race,'' he said. 

 Despite skepticism, even from adoption agencies that warned that white families do not normally adopt African children, Gallagher received dozens of responses within days of placing ads in the newspaper. 

 Charlene Chatot was one of those callers. For three years, Chatot and her husband, Paul, a nurse, have wanted to adopt a child, but finances have prevented them from doing so. But shortly after Chatot, 40, the mother of two teenagers, read in the newspaper about Gallagher's efforts and the low cost of the adoption, she accompanied Gallagher on a plane to Ethiopia. 

 ``We felt it was the right thing to do,'' said Chatot of her plans to adopt a 4-year-old Ethiopian boy. 

 Although Chatot, Gallagher, and school officials say they do not see the color of a person's skin, Smith and even multiracial adoption proponents say it is because they never had to: Most of the schools in Chester have few if any minority children. 

 ``Vermont is not Utopia. There is a resistance and the lack of acknowledgment that it could be racist,'' said one white mother whose adopted daughter is black. 

 The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of her daughter being taunted more, said the child has had problems in the school district. She said the family is considering moving from Windsor County to a more diversified area. 

 Black and Asian students have always stood out in Vermont. Nearly 15 years ago, when 18 black basketball players from Boston got off a bus at Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, it sent dozens of white children to the school window in awe, said Jim Collins, one of the school's administrators. 

 Gallagher said her goal is to find adoptive families in Ethiopia for the 20,000 orphans. Meanwhile, communities such as Chester, Norwich, Brattleboro, and White River Junction, as well as some New Hampshire towns, are working to bring a piece of Ethiopia to northern New England. 

 International festivals are being planned, a local therapist has volunteered to counsel the families, and local Ethiopians have agreed to make frequent visits to provide lessons on the African culture, such as how to cook injera, an Ethiopian staple that resembles a spongy bread. 

 So far, 23 of nearly 60 Vermont families _ professionals, working-class, and single parents _ have completed a state and immigration process to adopt 29 children. Gallagher, who has used her own money to set up the program and for travel, has a local adoption agency called Adoption Advocates Inc. as the international license holder. She is awaiting a license from The Children and Youth Administration in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. 

 According to an Ethiopian government spokesman, Ethiopians prefer that their children remain within their own culture. ``But I think we have to look at it from the interest of the babies. In Ethiopia we have one policy: Adoptions are done for children that do not have any choices,'' said Tsegay Wolde-Georgis of the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington. ``The option between being adopted by a loving family, whoever he is, and being a street child is a very easy answer.'' 

 But Kevin Christie, the only black school administrator in Vermont and a resident of White River Junction, said racism can be subtle and the old ways of thinking can be hard to shake. 

 ``It will probably be difficult for them,'' he said. But Collins, the administrator who may soon have two Ethiopians at the high school, which has only one black student registered this fall, thinks it will help open the minds of the isolated rural students who often hold stereotypes of people different from them. 

 When Chatot, who works for a pregnancy program, traveled to Ethiopia, she said the only difference she saw between Vermont and Ethiopia was the extreme poverty. 

 The children, who are living in an orphanage in Tigre, have survived bombings but have watched their parents become victims of the war. To remind herself of their plight, Gallagher brought the tattered clothing of some of the orphans who struggle daily to keep warm and fed. 

 In Vermont, where many families make their living from farming, the next day's meal can be as close as the backyard chicken coop. 

 ``In my opinion, a fat child would be more discriminated against than a person of a different race,'' said Gallagher, who will take in two teenage boys. 

 While that statement might seem naive in a country seemingly obsessed with race, state officials such as Kathy Huit of the governor's office said the comment embraces the accepting spirit that has long been part of Vermont's history, the first state to ban slavery in its constitution. 

 ``Vermont has prided itself on its history of tolerance,'' she said. ``And the governor is making sure we look at the issue of diversity. He's made it his commitment.'' 

 ``I think Vermont can be accepting, but there is still that element of ignorance,'' Christie said. The adoptive parents ``will need support.'' 

 Recently he had several students prosecuted at Randolph Area Vocation Center, where he is the administrator, for spray-painting racial epithets on the walls. 

 Christie, whose wife is white, has 26 years of living in Vermont to teach him how to survive in an all-white environment. He picks his battles, and matter-of-factly drives three hours to his native Hartford, Conn., to buy black hair-care products. Those skills were passed along to his daughter, and he hopes Vermonters will pass them to the new immigrants.
