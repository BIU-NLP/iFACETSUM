A landmark treaty on international adoptions appeared headed for enactment by the United States, with House passage Tuesday of legislation to implement the pact and an announcement that the Senate's lone holdout now supports ratification. 

 The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption worldwide. 

 ``I honestly believe the enactment of this treaty will, to a large degree, eliminate the abuses that currently exist,'' said US Rep. William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, who was instrumental in winning passage of the House measure. ``The lack of ratification was going to have disastrous consequences for all Americans who are interested in international adoptions.'' 

 Among its major provisions, the treaty would: establish the first global standards intended to protect children from being sold and improve procedures for finding them homes; prevent coercion of birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their children; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise steamline the process for adoptive parents. 

 Sources on Capitol Hill and within the US adoption community predicted enactment of the implementing legislation and of the treaty itself could be completed before Congress adjourns for its August recess. 

 US ratification was delayed partly because the process is lengthy, but also because some American politicians wanted to amend the agreement in ways that were so controversial that they stalled its consideration. 

 In recent months, as a carefully crafted compromise draft of the implementing legislation appeared close to passage, one lawmaker in the Senate and one in the House threatened to use parliamentary maneuvers to prevent the treaty's ratification if their concerns weren't addressed. 

 Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, had wanted the implementing legislation to preclude adoptions by homosexuals, unmarried Americans, and others with ``promiscuous lifestyles.'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said he feared the proposed rules would increase costs for adoptive parents and impose cumbersome standards that would drive small practitioners out of business. 

 Smith finally gave his okay to the House measure after it some changes that appear to give him some of what he wanted. The implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions. The revision obtained by Smith dictates that the US central authority will notify American practitioners of the criteria set by other countries for prospective adoptive parents. 

 Because China and some other nations are averse to adoption of their children by gay and single adults, many would-be parents could be excluded. But there's a loophole: The ``sending'' country would have to formally notify the US central authority of any restrictions _ which may not happen because it's in the interest of those countries to find families for thousands of orphaned and homeless children. 

 Similarly subtle concessions appear to have been made to win over Brownback. Asked during a telephone interview whether the senator was now ready to support passage of the Hague Convention, his spokesman, Erik Hotmire, replied: ``He now supports the legislation. ... The deal is done.'' 

 One ``improvement'' cited by Hotmire is that individual states, in addition to the federal government, will be able to establish entities like central authorities that could set guidelines and accredit adoption practitioners. Many if not most states, however, would probably leave such undertakings to the State Department _ which currently has jurisdiction over international adoptions and would be the home of America's central authority. 

 The other revision obtained by Brownback, who with his wife adopted a daughter from China last December, was to insert language giving extra time for small and medium agencies to meet the treaty's standards and gain accreditation. This was not a major sticking point for any of the pact's negotiators. 

 The final product, said William Pierce, the former president of the National Council for Adoption and the organization's consultant on the Hague Convention, ``clearly shows a lot of subtle, nuanced negotiations between people like Mr. Smith and Mr. Delahunt.'' He added: ``It is a win for everyone.'' 

 The most important immediate result, according to nearly everyone interviewed, is that nations with concerns about American adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania, which have recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured about the US commitment to reform. 

 The Hague Convention, named for the Netherlands capital where it was drafted, was completed in May 1993. Since then, 40 nations have enacted it. 

 The United States is by far the largest ``receiving'' nation of international adoptees. Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double the number of just a decade earlier.
