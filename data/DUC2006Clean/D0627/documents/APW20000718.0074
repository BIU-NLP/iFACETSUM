WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions passed the House on Tuesday after months of gridlock over whether it would allow gay adoptions. 

 The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud. 

 The bill the House passed would give various federal agencies the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The United States signed the measure in 1994. 

 Senate aides say lawmakers there may take up the measure soon and even ratify it before Congress leaves for its August recess. 

 ''We hope this Intercountry Adoption Act will not only demonstrate America's commitment to the child ... but will enable those adoptions to go more smoothly and more rapidly,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. 

 The measure had hit a snag in recent months as lawmakers debated whether it would allow gay adoptions. 

 Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., successfully lobbied for a provision that requires the United States to adhere to the laws of countries that may have marriage requirements or guidelines dealing with sexual orientation. Several countries, such as China, Romania and Bulgaria, prohibit gay adoptions. 

 Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud. 

 ''Documented abuses range from the charging of exorbitant fees by so-called 'facilitators' in some countries to child kidnapping,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass. and the father of a daughter who came to the United States from Vietnam in the early 1970s, before the fall of Saigon. 

 ''This bill will help ensure that adoptions are safe, that they are in the best interest of the child, the birth parent and the adoptive parent,'' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich. 

 More than 15,000 international adoptions are expected to take place this year. The majority of children adopted in the United States will come from China, official said. 

 In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the House measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally.
