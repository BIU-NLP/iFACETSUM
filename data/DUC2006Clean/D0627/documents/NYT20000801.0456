Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96. 

 Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers. 

 In 1954, Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in Korean orphanages. 

 ``We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Holt later wrote in ``The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ``We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.'' 

 At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many. 

 At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier. 

 At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night. 

 Harry Holt returned to Korea for more children, while Holt found families in the United States willing to take them. 

 In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted. 

 The Holts, who were Baptist, believed, with missionary fervor, that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year. 

 Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in Korea. Holt is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. 

 Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ``custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own. 

 In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Harry Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. 

 There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Harry Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission. 

 While in Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but his wife took over, traveling endlessly. Holt also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs. 

 ``She would say, `You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,''' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president. 

 In 1966, President Johnson named Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995, she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Cox said, Holt liked to say that she preferred the photographs that children sent from all over the world. 

 ``She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Holt's death. 

 In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times. 

 Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.
