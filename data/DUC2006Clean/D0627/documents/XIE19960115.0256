OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Children's Bridge, an international adoption agency in Canada said in a memorandum that Chinese orphanages including the disabled children are "well fed and well cared for". 

 The memorandum dated January 12 and available here today forms a sharp contrast with the allegations of abuse and deliberate neglect resulting in death in Chinese orphanages as reported in the British documentary, "The Dying Room" and recent reports from the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. 

 It said the Children's Bridge has been actively involved in adoptions of Chinese children since 1991. "In the course of those adoptions, approximately 200 persons involved with the Children's Bridge have visited 18 orphanages in Central China. Several of our parents have been health care professionals," it said. 

 The memorandum said "our parents have freely taken between 50 and 60 hours of videotape and hundreds of photographs. In the course of their visits, they have had little or no restraints in terms of their tours through the orphanages." 

 "In our involvement with these Chinese orphanages not one of our parents has reported or filmed any evidence of mistreatment of any of the children at any time," it said. 

 The memorandum said "over the course of these visits, we have encountered many disabled children who appear clean, well fed and well cared for." 

 The Children's Bridge has become increasingly concerned with the allegations reported by the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Human Rights Watch, the memorandum said. "It is essential that our hundreds of positive contacts with Chinese orphanages be balanced against the two reports." 

 It said "our interactions with the doctors, directors, nurses and nannies associated directly with the orphanages and with the officials of the China welfare ministry have, without exception, been very positive and characterized by their genuine concern with the well being and welfare of the children in their charge."
