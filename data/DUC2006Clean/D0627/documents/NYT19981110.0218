Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo, N.Y., waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows scant signs of being ready to be born. 

 The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs. Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two families have gotten to know each other well these past few months, by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears. 

 Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and Rosario and helping care for their three other children. 

 ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms. Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker. 

 Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms. Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations. 

 The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him. 

 The intimacy between these two families would have been rare just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions into an infinitely more transparent experience. 

 How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number, since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from 1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives. 

 The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control, the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are fewer than 20,000 a year. 

 As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by those children adopted from other countries whose physical differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact. 

 In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their families and that story is shared with relatives, friends, teachers, sometimes even strangers. 

 ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a 6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother'' and ``natural mother.'' 

 Where once children hid their adoption from friends, if they even knew of it, adopted children today can belong to play groups made up entirely of adopted children. They can buy storybooks about being adopted, go to summer camps for children adopted from particular foreign countries, and if they face emotional difficulties, get treated by a therapist who specializes in adoption. 

 In some cities, like New York, San Francisco and Boston, playgrounds are peppered with parents of various races and nationalities chasing children of other races. Many of those families are headed by single people, people in their '40s or older and gay people, men and women who, in years past, would have been rejected as unsuitable adoptive parents. 

 Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama of the American family now includes children born through advanced reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who have hired a surrogate to bear a child. 

 ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a research group in New York. 

 In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption. 

 In the 1990s, it became a kind of social phenomenon to adopt a child from abroad. Last summer, Vanity Fair magazine quipped that a Chinese baby was the season's hot accessory in the Hamptons. The experience, however, is not limited to wealthy neighborhoods. Suburban American and rural towns are also home to children adopted from Shanghai, Murmansk, Guatemala City, Bucharest. 

 Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call the ``Ovarian Olympics.'' 

 Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born.'' 

 In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small family-run business that focuses on adoption.
