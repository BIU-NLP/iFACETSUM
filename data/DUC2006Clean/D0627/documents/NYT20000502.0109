All over the country, people like Alison Doane are growing more nervous by the day. Some have waited weeks, others months for the Russian child whose picture they gaze at incessantly, and who they have been promised will soon become their own. Now, suddenly, adoption agencies are telling them that they can't be sure when they'll get their children. 

 ``I would say that we, as a group, are scared,'' Doane, a musician from Malden, Mass., says. ``We're optimistic the adoptions will eventually go through ... but the uncertainty makes people agitated, and the ones in line the longest are up in arms.'' 

 The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the face of international adoption. 

 The impact of Russia's actions is potentially huge because it provides more children for adoption abroad than any other country, and the vast majority of those adoptees go to the United States. Significantly, at a time when most children adopted abroad by white Americans are of a different race, Russia also is the largest foreign source of Caucasian children. 

 Russian's new laws were signed last week as decrees by President-elect Vladimir Putin, but they were barely reported by the world's media. The statutes appear designed, in part, to show the incoming leader's nationalistic stripes, but they are principally intended to halt bribery, child-selling, and other illegal activities allegedly occurring during the course of placing Russian orphans in US adoptive homes. 

 In particular, bribes of thousands of dollars are regularly doled out to judges, orphanage officials and, most frequently and generously, to bilingual intermediaries who guide would-be parents through often-confusing bureaucratic and judicial systems. 

 Nearly all the intermediaries are Russian nationals who work simultaneously for several agencies, attorneys, and adoption facilitators in the United States -- making the operatives' loyalties suspect and their operations difficult to monitor. And some officials in Washington and Moscow believe members of the Russian Mafia are involved in adoption procedures there. 

 Putin aims to clean up the process by imposing numerous reforms, effective immediately. The most important are banning intermediaries; allowing only nonprofit, accredited adoption agencies with a minimum of five years' experience to function; ordering each agency to open its own office with separate, salaried employees; and mandating that all involved report on their activities and pay taxes on income received. 

 Currently, all of the estimated 160 to 180 US agencies conducting business in Russia employ intermediaries, and none are accredited because it has never been a requirement before. So none can initiate new adoptions until specific operating guidelines are established, primarily by the Ministry of Education but with input from five additional government departments as well. 

 Adoptions already in the pipeline are being allowed to proceed, but at the discretion of individual judges in local jurisdictions around Russia. It also is legal for prospective parents to navigate that nation's legal and governmental adoption bureaucracies without the assistance of an agency or intermediary, although generally with the help of a Russian lawyer. 

 ``We tell applicants to stand by, because it's not possible to know how long all of this will take to resolve,'' said Filis Casey, executive director of the Alliance for Children in Wellesley, one of the largest adoption agencies in New England. ``We don't think Russian adoptions will stop, but when something like this happens, it sends shivers through the adoption community, because you can't know for sure what will happen.'' 

 Like most of the adoption professionals interviewed thius week, Casey said she didn't expect the delays in Russia to last more than a few months. But other practitioners predicted that, given Moscow's notoriously slow bureaucracies and some of the entrenched problems in the adoption system, it could take a year or more for the new procedures to be fully implemented. 

 All those involved said they were worried about the children who will remain longer in orphanages while the new laws are being put in place. However much good the changes might eventually do, many of those facilities are badly run, lack funds, and are staffed by personnel who mistreat the boys and girls living within them; experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions, the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur. 

 Those interviewed, however, pointed out that every nation that allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised its rules, especially during changes in government. Most notably, that happened several times during the 1990s in China, which ranked at the top of ``sending'' adoption nations until Russia assumed that standing a few years ago. 

 According to the latest State Department tally, Americans adopted 4,348 children from Russia in 1999, compared to 4,101 from China. The reforms instituted by Beijing over the years have made that country's adoption process perhaps the least-corrupt in the world; the third-highest source nation, South Korea (with 2,008 adoptees leaving last year), also runs operations that professionals believe is very clean. 

 So, if Russia is able to follow through on its promises, it would mean the lopsided majority of adoptions in the world will be done ethically and with a minimum of shady activity. Almost 16,400 children from all nations, including some where such crimes as bribery, coercion, and baby theft are frequently reported, were adopted into the United States last year. 

 ``It certainly has the potential to slow down the process, but we believe that will be temporary. And in the long run we're hoping it's a beneficial change because it makes the process more credible and provides assurances to prospective parents about the people they're working with, as well as to the Russian federation,'' said Mike Walsh, a vice president for Lutheran Social Services of New England. 

 Jennifer Goodbody, head of the Russian adoption section of Spence-Chapin in New York -- one of the nation's largest adoption agencies -- said Putin's changes could have ripple effects. As would-be parents look elsewhere, for instance, she said it is likely other nations will be swamped with applications that could also slow down their processes. 

 Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates and studies adoption in Eastern Europe, said the Russian reforms also will have another certain effect: persuading other nations to follow suit. Hogan, who returned from a fact-finding tour of Romania last week, said that country already is studing Moscow's actions and is likely to institute similar reforms soon. 

 ``These countries are saying, `We know there's a pressing need to find homes for all these children,' '' said Hogan, a vocal proponent of squeezing financial corruption out of the adoption process. ``But they're not willing to sacrifice these kids on the alter of commercialism.''
