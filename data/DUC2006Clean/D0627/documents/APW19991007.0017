BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- After months at a Bogota adoption center at the center of a bizarre custody battle, a pair of 8-month-old twins will be returned to their Indian tribe after its elders promised not to hurt the children. 

 Customarily, the U'wa tribe abandons newborn twins in the forest or tosses them into rivers, believing they are ill-equipped for life and bring bad luck. 

 Juan and Keila Aguablanca were spared that fate when their parents left them in a public health clinic three days after their Feb. 11 birth. Their case drew attention to customs many Colombians consider barbaric and put the U'wa once again in the public spotlight. 

 The combative 8,000-member tribe threatened mass suicide in 1997 in a successful protest to stop oil drilling on their lands and has become a cause celebre among many U.S. environmentalists and indigenous rights groups. 

 Stung by the negative publicity in the Aguablanca twin case, the group decided to fight the adoption process and demand the children's return. 

 The director of Colombia's Institute for Family Welfare, Juan Manuel Urrutia, said Thursday that the government had decided to return the twins to the U'wa after the tribe ``agreed to place the rights of these two children above their cultural beliefs.'' 

 He said the babies would be returned within 10 days. 

 The U'wa's legal adviser, Ebaristo Tegria, said the tribe's leaders had met and agreed to make an exception to the people's tradition. 

 ``Most important now is that the youngsters return to the community,'' Tegria said in a telephone interview from Cubara, a town 200 miles northeast of Bogota just outside the U'wa reservation. 

 Tribal spokesman Jose Cobaria said Juan and Keila's parents had been isolated from the rest of the community so they could be cleansed of impurities linked to the birth. For four years, he said, they could not visit other houses or share food with neighbors. 

 Tribal leaders said the children would be returned to their parents.
