Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide, and curtail corruption in the process. 

 Leaders of the American adoption community and sources on Capitol Hill said the two Republicans _ Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey _ are the sole roadblocks to passage of legislation implementing the treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. It has already been approved by 40 other countries. 

 Brownback last week used a maneuver called a ``hold'' to stall consideration of the measure. He said his opposition to the implementing legislation stems largely from the advice of Laura Cecere, the operator of a Cambridge, Mass. adoption service who helped him adopt a daughter from China last December. 

 Brownback maintained in an interview that the bill would raise adoption costs and impose standards that could drive small firms like Cecere's out of business. 

 Smith did not respond to requests for an interview. But, according to people in and out of Washington who have helped to draft the implementing legislation, he is holding out mainly because he wants to include language precluding homosexuals and other Americans with ``promiscuous lifestyles'' from adopting. 

 The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high. Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double the number of just 10 years earlier. 

 ``It's an amazing time for the institution,'' said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York. ``I think that's one reason the time is right for this treaty now and why it's so very important.'' 

 Even if Brownback's ``hold'' were lifted, both he and Smith have indicated a willingness to impede passage of the legislation as currently written by introducing potentially fractious amendments and using other parliamentary maneuvers that could tie up the House and Senate at a time when most members are anxious to complete their business as quickly as possible so they can go home to campaign. 

 ``The leadership doesn't want a protracted, potentially divisive floor fight, so a single, determined congressman can block the entire bill,'' said Fred Greenman, the legal adviser to the American Adoption Congress. 

 The fight over bringing the bill to the floor of Congress _ it has already been approved by pertinent committees in both houses _ is most striking because the measure enjoys the backing of an unusually wide array of ideological factions on Capitol Hill and in the adoption world. 

 After months of delicate negotiations, the end product won the support of politicians ranging from Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is its primary sponsor, to Representative William D. Delahunt, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who has been instrumental in putting together the broad congressional coalition. 

 At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents. 

 Some of these activists, like the American Adoption Congress and the National Council for Adoption, vehemently disagree on nearly every other topic relating to adoption practices but have decided to put aside their lingering differences about some of the treaty's details because they view its overall purpose as so important. 

 ``This is a historic document that will protect needy kids and increase the chances for them to be adopted. Not passing it would be a major embarrassment for the United States and an enormous human-rights setback for the children,'' said Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates, which finds homes for special-needs children nationwide. 

 The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993. Since then, 29 nations have ratified the treaty and 11 others have accepted it by a process called accession. The United States is among 11 original signatories to the pact that have not ratified it. 

 In this country, only the Senate can approve a treaty, but both chambers must approve legislation spelling out how it will be implemented. The fight in Congress is over that legislation. 

 The treaty would require firms operating abroad to radically alter some of their practices, which currently receive little regulation or monitoring and which have always been the nearly exclusive purview of state governments. 

 The pact calls for each member nation to create a ``central authority'' _ meaning a significant federal role _ to deal with issues that include breaking down procedural and legal barriers among participants, preventing practitioners from exploiting birth parents or making improper financial gains, and upgrading the conditions and protecting the rights of institutionalized children. 

 Assuming they adhered to the letter of the treaty, participants would be obliged to toughen some of their laws and regulations. Perhaps most significantly, the central authorities would have to certify agencies that want to operate in other Hague treaty nations, and would be required to set rigorous standards by which those agencies would be legally bound to abide. 

 By all accounts, the treaty's implementation would lead to unprecedented changes for agencies, lawyers, and facilitators who now function with minimal and often-haphazard rules, particularly abroad. Adoption-reform organizations say this climate invites illegalities and dubious practices, ranging from bribery and coercion of birth parents to obtain their babies, to the establishment of adoption businesses by people who have little or no experience but want to cash in on the thousands of American individuals and couples who each pay tens of thousands of dollars for overseas adoptions annually. 

 ``I think once the United States passes this, it will make a real difference,'' said Delahunt. While he and other proponents emphasized that they did not expect extensive improvements overnight, they asserted that the treaty is an essential step toward cleaning up existing abuses, enhancing adoption's image, and leading more Americans to adopt as a result. 

 Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80 percent of the world's adoptees, US ratification also would serve as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their treatment of children. 

 People on all sides of the congressional debate stressed they agreed with the goals Delahunt outlined and said they believed reforms of the type envisioned in the Hague Convention will go a long way toward achieving them. Sources familiar with Smith's views said he feels strongly about promoting ``family values'' at the same time, however, and Brownback insisted he only wants to ensure that the implementing legislation doesn't cause harm even as it attempts to do good. 

 ``I'm hopeful we can get this through,'' the senator said from his home in Kansas Friday, ``but I have a fundamental concern that, without some fixing, this could actually reduce the number of international adoptions rather than grow it.'' 

 Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process. The resulting procedures and regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could drive some prospective parents out of the market. 

 He added that small agencies, in particular, would find it administratively difficult and expensive to adhere to rule-changes, and therefore could be forced out of business. The implementing legislation, in response to concerns from Cecere, does give small firms such as hers an additional two years to comply with any new mandates, but Brownback said that would not be sufficient. 

 Brownback said he favors making the central authority in this country a body that would maintain a registry of adoption practitioners, but would not certify them or establish rules. It's unclear whether that would comply with the treaty itself.
