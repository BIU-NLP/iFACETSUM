BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China will not impose more restrictions on Chinese children adopted by foreigners but will have more detailed and standardized adoption procedures, legislators said here today. 

 A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions, according to a member of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, Wan Shaofen, who was debating the draft. 

 In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC Standing Committee last Monday, Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption of Chinese children by foreigners, but Wan pointed out today that "requirements" means adoption procedures. 

 She said that new procedures could help protect the safety and interests of children who are up for adoption and prevent international crimes. 

 One of the members, Chen Junliang, said that adoption procedures should be simplified with fewer restrictions for foreigners. 

 From 1992 to 1997, there were 2,403 adoptions in Liaoning Province, only five of which were by foreigners.
