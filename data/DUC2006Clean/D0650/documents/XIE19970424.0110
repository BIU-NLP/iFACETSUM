LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Troops of the West African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, have been deployed to 38 locations outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia, a report reaching here said today. 

 This will make things easy for ECOMOG to dispatch troops to all voting centers across the country to keep order for the forthcoming May 30 elections, the report said, quoting ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu. 

 Malu made the remarks during a meeting on Wednesday with a delegation of the Carter Center, a US-based organization working in furtherance of democratic elections around the world. 

 According to him, all sea ports and most of the border crossing points were now being effectively policed by ECOMOG to further enhance security nationwide, prevent arms movement in or out of Liberia and give confidence to returning refugees. 

 The Nigerian general reiterated ECOMOG was working hard to ensure that the elections would be conducted in a very transparent and honest environment so that if a party lost, such party would know that it lost because the Liberian people rejected it and not because of fraud. 

 ECOMOG was already fully prepared to deal with such situation under which anyone attempted to cause trouble after such an honest election, Malu warned. 

 According to Gordon Streeb, leader of the delegation, the former US president Jimmy Carter would lead a delegation of about 60 observers to Liberia as a reflection of the importance the center attaches to the success of the country's post-war elections. 

 The presence of Carter and his delegation to monitor the elections is also seen as part of efforts to enhance the credibility of the polls.
