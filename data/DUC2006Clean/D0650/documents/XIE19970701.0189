LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The much-speculated postponement of Nigeria's governorship election to next year was confirmed during a meeting between Head of State General Sani Abacha and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter on Sunday. 

 At a news conference in Abuja, the capital, at the end of his two-day visit to Nigeria, Carter said General Abacha confirmed the shift to him, according to local press reports today. 

 But Carter gave no details of the election originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year according to the military administration's three-year transition to civil rule program announced in October 1995. 

 "He was pleading with me that although the election of governors for this year will not be held as scheduled in October, the governorship election will be held next year, the same year as election for president," Carter added. 

 He said Abacha reassured him on certain decisions made by the government to have free and democratic elections so that the October 1, 1998 military disengagement date could be realized. 

 The former U.S. president said there was no assurance yet on the release of former head of state General Obasanjo and Major-General Yar'Adua imprisoned on alleged involvement of a coup, as well as the detention of Chief M.K.O. Abiola for alleged treason. Abiola was said to be the winner of the annulled presidential election in 1993. 

 Their imprisonment was the cause of the lingering strained relations between Nigeria and America, said Carter, now head of the Carter Center, a foundation committed to the eradication of Guinea-worm and river blindness in Africa. 

 He said: "A lot of problems have been brought about by the fact that the rule of law in Nigeria has not been prosecuted properly." 

 However, while kicking against the imposition of further sanctions on Nigeria, Carter said he would see improved diplomatic ties between Abuja and Washington. 

 Western countries have imposed sanctions on Nigeria since the military administration's execution of nine minority nationality activists in November 1995. 

 The alleged poor human rights record in the country has come under fresh attack from Britain and the U.S., with the new British Labor government vowing that it would not compromise its tough stand until there is a positive change by the military government. 

 The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) has invited Nigeria's opposition National Democratic Coalition and several pro-democracy groups to London for discussion on the country's political situation. 

 The discussions, expected for July 10, are to enable CMAG to decide whether the suspension slammed on Nigeria two years ago should be lifted, retained or even changed to expulsion.
