ISLAMABAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been awarded by an international organization, Carter Center of the USA, for being the first Asian country to eradicate the Guinea Worm disease, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Wednesday. 

 The award was presented to the representative of the Embassy of Pakistan in the United States by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at a special ceremony held in Atlanta recently. 

 The World Health Organization estimated in 1986 that more than 3 million people annually became infested with Guinea Worm in tropical Africa, India and Pakistan. 

 Pakistan initiated its Guinea Worm Eradication Program in 1987, and was the first country in Asia to eradicate the disease two years ahead of the global target. 

 Victims of the disease get the roundworms from stagnant, untreated drinking water, which could grow in the body to reach a length of two to three feet. 

 The mature worms burrow toward the skin and release poison that destroys tissue, causing a blister or abscess. As many as 40 worms wriggle from one person.
