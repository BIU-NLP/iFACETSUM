BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Carter Center of the United States, led by Charles E Costello, director of the center's democracy program, arrived in Beijing this evening to observe the election of township-level people's deputies. 

 Invited by the National People's Congress (NPC) Foreign Affairs Committee, the delegation is scheduled to discuss grass-roots democracy issues with officials from both the NPC and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and observe the direct elections of people's deputies in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality during its 10-day inspection tour. 

 This is the first time for an overseas non-governmental organization to inspect elections of China's local power organs, since the Carter Center's two previous inspections of villagers' committee elections in 1997 and 1998. 

 Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his wife, the Carter Center has been devoted to observing many countries in respect of democracy and development, human rights issues and public health. 

 To date, the Carter Center has monitored elections in at least 12 countries, and the inspection of China's villagers' committee over the past two years has proven to be successful. 

 Dr. Robert Pastor, who headed the center's two inspection delegations to China, said on his last trip,"Our entire delegation was impressed by what we saw and by the commitment of the villagers to have free and fair elections, by the competition, and by the sincerity with which the Chinese officials try to make this election successful."
