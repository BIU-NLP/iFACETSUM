LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to monitor the on- going transition program in the country. 

 In a statement issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, he said his center and the U.S. National Democratic Institute for International Affairs would send a 40-to-50-member team to observe the February 27 presidential polls which would draw the curtain on the transfer of power from the military to civilians on May 29. 

 The two organizations are monitoring all phases of the local, state and national elections in the west African country, The Post Express reported Friday. 

 In the statement, Carter said the observation of the transit program was designed "to support and call international attention to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society." 

 While in the country, he will meet Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar, leaders of the three political parties, the Independent National Electoral Commission and other groups. 

 Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said Thursday that his organization was satisfied with the progress of the on-going transition program in Nigeria, according to local newspaper The Guardian. 

 Anyaoku who is on a working holiday in the country said "Nigeria will definitely return (to Commonwealth) on May 29 as long as the nation continues to show respect for fundamental values such as democracy, human rights, the rule of law and independence of the judiciary. 

 Nigeria was suspended from the 53-nation Commonwealth in 1995 following the hanging of nine Ogoni minority rights activists by the military government of late General Sani Abacha. 

 The Commonwealth chief said "the people of Nigeria demonstrated keenness and eagerness to have democracy and the election is a reflection of the will of the electorate."
