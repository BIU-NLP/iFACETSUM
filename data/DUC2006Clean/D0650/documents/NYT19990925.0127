ATLANTA _ The famous face carries the weight of 75 years of victory and defeat. The skin laps loose over his collar. The eyes have a slightly milky cast. 

 But his vigor speaks of a much younger man. He remains remarkably fit and compulsively active, still a figure on the world stage, his stamina, energy and intellect apparently undiminished by the passing of the years. And when he smiles the famous grin, the years fall way and he looks much as he did when he was president of the United States 20 years ago. 

 Jimmy Carter, who was 52 when he was inaugurated in 1977, will turn 75 on Friday. Friends and supporters will celebrate the occasion in Americus with performances by entertainers as disparate as Pat Boone and the Indigo Girls. 

 He remains a vigorous man, rising every day at 5 a.m., exercising daily, overseeing the Carter Center, hand-crafting a crib for his newest grandchild, fly fishing, writing two books, climbing mountains, and monitoring elections around the world _ including, this year, those in Nigeria and Indonesia and one still to come in Mozambique. 

 He remains, said Rosalynn Carter, his wife of 53 years, what he has always been _ a man constitutionally unable to sit still and do nothing. 

 And yet there's a difference. 

 In the past, Carter was known for his sharp tongue and occasional iciness. Now he seems downright amiable. He appears more comfortable, less driven. He knows full well that the last few grains of sand are sliding through the hourglass, and that his robust health could desert him at any time. 

 But, he said in an interview, he does not grieve that his time is running out. He has no fear of death. And this, he said, is the happiest time of his life. 

 ``We are free to choose what items on our menu we want to adopt,'' he said. ``We are kind of the matriarch and patriarch of our family. We hold our family together _ there are about 20 of us; we have 10 grandchildren. We are secure in Plains, which is still a tiny little town, 712 people. We have the land that belonged to our ancestors since the Indians left, you might say. We are deeply committed to our church there.'' 

 And he said his work, which remains the focus of his life, is exciting, challenging, unpredictable and gratifying. 

 There may be another reason for the change, as well. Carter's achievements in the years since voters evicted him from the White House have eased the pain of his 1980 loss to Ronald Reagan. Historian Douglas Brinkley, who is writing a three-volume biography of Carter, said the former president seems at last to be comfortable with the Jimmy Carter life story. 

 ``There has been a complete and total reconciliation for Jimmy Carter,'' Brinkley said. ``He is totally at peace with everything he does.'' 

 Carter's career as a former president has lasted almost 19 years, longer than the 18 years between his election to the Georgia state Senate and his expulsion from the White House. He has compiled a record that Brinkley considers the finest of any ex-president, equaled perhaps only by that of John Quincy Adams. 

 Carter has contributed to the near global eradication of Guinea worm disease, a centuries-old affliction. His high-profile, high-stakes diplomatic missions produced a cease-fire in Bosnia, stopped a U.S. invasion of Haiti and may have averted a war in North Korea. 

 His condemnation of fraudulent elections, and his support of honest ones, has earned him adulation throughout Latin America and Africa. Brinkley estimates that, by interceding privately with world leaders, Carter had been directly responsible for the release of about 50,000 political prisoners. And in August, Carter and his wife were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

 ``Somewhere in the mad rush of his ex-presidency, he lost this striver's impulse, which was a big part of him,'' Brinkley said. ``I think you are getting a more mellow, kind-hearted Jimmy Carter as he gets older.'' 

 For Carter, however, mellow does not mean inactive. 

 ``When we're at home, if he's not writing a book or doing something, he's miserable,'' Rosalynn said. ``He can't do nothing.'' 

 His apparent vigor, say those who know him, is no illusion. A lifetime of healthy foods, a rigorous determination to maintain his ideal weight, and a disciplined devotion to daily exercise have paid dividends. 

 ``When he was up here fishing for three days, I had to collapse for a day, 'cause I couldn't do it,'' said media mogul Ted Turner, who invites the Carters to his ranch in Montana every year. ``And I'm only 60.'' 

 When the Carters are on the road, they run virtually every morning. They recently ran about four miles through the streets of New York, for example, before settling down to watch the U.S. Open. When they are home in Plains, they ride bicycles or play two full sets of tennis _ often, Carter said, going to a tie-breaker. 

 ``So we're still climbing mountains, downhill skiing, fly fishing, riding, tennis _ we just have a good time,'' he said. 

 Carter said he feels no different than he did when he was 50, but he has made some concessions to age. He rarely runs more than 4 1/2 miles, compared with the six or seven miles a day he ran while he was president. 

 And, he said, ``Now I run at Rosalynn's pace.'' 

 The Carters do everything together _ whether traveling overseas, working at the Carter Center, taking vacations or exercising. ``Everything that I mentioned to you we do side by side,'' Carter said. ``It gives us a chance to spend some nice moments with each other.'' 

 Carter is grounded not only in a marriage gone right, but in his hometown, a place where people have known him all his life. He lives in the same house he and Rosalynn moved into in 1961. He teaches Sunday school every week he is in town _ 35 or 40 times a year _ just as he always did. Every fifth Saturday, he mows the church lawn and trims the shrubbery. Every sixth Saturday, Rosalynn vacuums the church and cleans the toilets. 

 ``We do our share without any fanfare, just as part of the community,'' Carter said. 

 ``We've done a lot of things, but we always go home,'' Rosalynn said. ``And that's one thing that's so good because .. when there were things that went wrong, or things that you would like to have had happen a different way, or we got a lot of criticisms, you knew that everybody back home was pulling for you. It makes a big difference, to have a base like that with a lot of family.'' 

 Carter goes home, but he doesn't sit still. He searches for challenges and attacks them with gusto. Before he wrote a book of poetry, he asked professors at Emory University to assign him reading material as they would any student. He mastered the material, and his book was a success. 

 He studied books on winemaking, then began making his own wine. 

 Now, one of the new books he is writing will be his first novel. Again he has sought reading assignments from professors at Emory. 

 ``He studies it, intensely, and sometimes for months and months,'' Rosalynn said, ``and then begins to write.'' 

 You never know what he will do, said Emily Dolvin, Carter's aunt. ``I wouldn't be surprised if he would do things like taking up the piano and doing a piano recital.'' 

 But much of the former president's work now appears aimed at consolidating the accomplishments he cares about. The novel, set in Georgia during the final years of the Revolutionary War, is based on genealogical research into Carter's family. 

 ``He's trying to keep the family history alive,'' Brinkley said. ``He's trying to find what's in the attic. His interest in the family genealogy is intense.'' 

 He tries to act as an example to his grandchildren. Carter's mother and all three of his siblings have died since he left the White House, so Carter, seeing himself as the patriarch, works to hold the family together. Every year, he and his wife take their children, grandchildren and any very significant others _ usually about 20 or 21 people, all told _ on a New Year's trip. This year, the destination is a ranch in Costa Rica. 

 The work at the Carter Center still consumes its namesake. The Carters try to limit their time in Atlanta to one week a month, during which time they live in a small apartment inside the center and cram every moment of their time with appointments. But often they find themselves spending more time at the center than that. 

 Carter is still clearly engaged in his work. Just as when he was president, he seems able to discuss the intricacies of virtually any conflict in the world. He was criticized as president for focusing too much on minutiae, but he remains a font of names, dates, facts and numbers. 

 ``You probably don't want me to quote statistics,'' he said in an interview _ and then did. He leaned forward eagerly as he described different facets of his work, sometimes apologizing for answering questions at too great a length. ``As you can see, my heart's in it,'' he said. 

 One of his major projects is ensuring that the Carter Center will continue to be a vital force after he and his wife are no longer able to work. He is trying to increase the center's endowment from $100 million to $250 million to keep the center healthy after it loses his and his wife's fund-raising prowess. And he is working to identify ``distinguished persons'' _ perhaps former Cabinet officers, senators or university presidents _ who might ensure that the center retains access to world leaders after he is gone. 

 Every once in a while, Rosalynn said, her husband will say, ``Look at that beautiful sunset. It might not be long before I won't see sunsets.'' 

 He's only joking, she said, never serious. It's true, though, she said, that he approaches death without fear. ``He just believes that there's life after death and it's going to be good, I guess,'' she said. 

 But Carter's son Jack, who works in financial services in Bermuda, doubts that his father will be going anywhere soon. 

 ``Dad's got this irritating ability to undertake this enormous amount of pain and effort as long as there's someone along who enjoys it less,'' Jack Carter said. ``I think for that reason, he'll probably live a long time.''
