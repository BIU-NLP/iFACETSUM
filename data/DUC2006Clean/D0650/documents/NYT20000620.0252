MEXICO CITY _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will be in Mexico on July 2 to observe this country's highly competitive presidential election, an elections monitoring groups said Tuesday. 

 The invitation to Carter came during an exploratory visit last week by representatives of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based non-profit group concerned with democracy and that has observed elections in more than a dozen countries in this hemisphere. 

 ``These elections are a watershed for Mexico,'' Carter said in a statement. ``The purpose of our mission is to assess the state of the electoral process, and to demonstrate by our presence and activities the confidence of the international community in the Mexican people's commitment to free and fair elections.'' 

 Emory University professor Robert Pastor, principle advisor to the delegation, said during the center's exploratory visit in Mexico allegations of vote-buying, coercion and other pre-election irregularities were raised by parties trying to unseat Mexico's ruling party. 

 ``These are legitimate concerns we are looking at,'' Pastor said. But, he added, ``it's not enough to have anecdotes.'' 

 Mexico has gone through sweeping electoral reforms since its last presidential election in 1994. Polls are showing that the two top candidates in the race are Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN). 

 ``The presidential election looks to be a very close race,'' Pastor said. ``While we were impressed by the trust that all parties had in the Federal Elections Institute (which conducts the balloting), we were persuaded of the need for a delegation by the leaders of all three 

 parties, some of whom shared their deep concerns about the potential for serious irregularities.'' 

 The parties hope that Carter's presence might ``deter irregularities and give people the confidence to vote their conscience,'' Pastor said. 

 Mexico's ambassador to the United States Jesus F. Reyes-Heroles sent a letter telling Carter his presence would be of ``remarkable importance'' to the election.
