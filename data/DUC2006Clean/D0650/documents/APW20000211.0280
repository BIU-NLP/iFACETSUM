LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Carter Center said Friday that Peru does not meet international standards for fair elections and demanded that President Alberto Fujimori's government take immediate steps to ensure a clean vote in April. 

 Peruvian officials ``must take a series of immediate actions that will guarantee a completely informed decision by voters when the ballot is cast,'' said former Costa Rica President Don Rodrigo Carazo, who led the delegation of Carter Center observers. 

 The Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter, made its conclusion in conjunction with the National Democratic Institute, another U.S. based pro-democracy group, after a five-day visit at the invitation of Fujimori's administration. 

 Fujimori responded that his government has already taken the necessary measures to ensure clean elections. 

 ``That is why, right now, there are no allegations of supposed persecution,'' he said. ``These types of charges have all vanished. Even more, the government has guaranteed the free movement of all candidates, without any inconvenience.'' 

 The delegation's list of irregularities ranged from the abuse of public assistance programs to garner votes to government manipulation of the media to limit air time and press coverage of opposition candidates and views critical of the president. 

 In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin welcomed the recommendation and said prompt action along those lines would help broaden and deepen democracy in Peru. 

 Fujimori's foes accuse his government of waging a systematic, illegal campaign of harassment to discredit and intimidate leading opposition candidates and election watchdog groups. 

 Amid charges that pro-government media are conspiring to deny air time to the opposition, the National Elections Board on Thursday told radio and television executives that they must broadcast political ads of all candidates. 

 Fujimori, who was first elected in 1990 and won a landslide reelection in 1995, has a wide lead in most election polls. 

 His opponents say his bid for a third consecutive term violates the constitution.
