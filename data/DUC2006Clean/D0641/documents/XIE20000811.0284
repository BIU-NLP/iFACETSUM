KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner for Meteorology Bwango Apuuli has warned of severe droughts in Uganda and East Africa during this season, the New Vision reported on Saturday. 

 Eastern Africa will have severe droughts, while southern Africa will face floods, he said, adding that the extreme weather events such as floods and droughts will increase in the frequency and intensity because of global warming. 

 "Global warming, associated with periodic warming of the neighboring oceans, has resulted in changes in the strength and characteristics of the monsoon winds that bring moisture into Uganda," Apuuli was quoted as saying. 

 The global atmospheric temperature had increased due to increase in greenhouse gases, said Apuuli, noting: "If significant reduction in greenhouse gases is not done, the average global temperature is predicted to raise by three degrees centigrade by the year 2001." 

 Communities should be prepared to adapt to the new weather phenomena, he said, urging the government to encourage rainwater harvesting, supplementary irrigation and energy conservation practices.
