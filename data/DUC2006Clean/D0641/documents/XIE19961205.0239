BEIJING, December 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists believe that global warming, particularly higher winter temperatures, will continue to the first half of the 21st century. 

 In a key research project underway since the early 1990s, nearly 100 scientists in China have concluded that the average global temperature has risen about 0.5 degrees Centigrade over the beginning of the century. 

 The scientists, led by Ye Duzheng, an aerophysicist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the increase rate of gases that cause the greenhouse effect will accelerate, so much so that the earth's warming trend will continue in the coming dozens of years. 

 Affected by natural changes and human activities, the average winter temperature in northern China by the year 2030 will be 1 to 1.5 degrees Centigrade higher than the present figure, according to the scientists. 

 On the other hand, the increase rate of summer temperatures will be lower than that in winter. 

 The scientists said that the warming effect, especially rising temperatures in winter, will result in a series of changes to nature and human society. The production of wheat will rise, while corn will yield a lower overall volume.
