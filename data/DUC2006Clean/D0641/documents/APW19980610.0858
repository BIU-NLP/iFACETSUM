Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently. Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature.' In the other scenario, the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down. With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,'' Oppenheimer said. Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration. Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate. In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century. Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature. Over time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts, the scientists said. To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012. While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting.' But Oppenheimer warned that, as countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date. Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said. Until recently, scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting. Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all. Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice, he added. In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of local atmospheric warming. While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be. In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice. Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area. Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres. While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process could begin in as early as 50 years. Some reports said the process already had begun. In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the melting to slow down.
