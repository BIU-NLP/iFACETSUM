Over the years, skeptics have tried to cast doubt on the idea of global warming by noting that measurements taken by earth satellites since 1979 have found little or no temperature rise in large parts of the upper atmosphere. The satellites' all-encompassing coverage yields more reliable results than temperature samplings showing a century-long warming trend at the earth's surface, they argued. 

 In January, a special study by the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, declared that the ``apparent disparity'' between the two sets of measurements over the 20-year history of the satellite measurements ``in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising.'' The surface warming ``is undoubtedly real,'' the study panel said. 

 But the dissenters are a long way from conceding the debate, and they have seized on other aspects of the panel's report in an effort to bolster their case. 

 To be sure, according to interviews with some prominent skeptics, there is now wide agreement among them that the average surface temperature of the earth has indeed risen. 

 ``I don't think we're arguing over whether there's any global warming,'' said Dr. William M. Gray, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, known for his annual predictions of Atlantic hurricane activities as well as his staunch, longtime dissent on global climate change. ``The question is, `What is the cause of it?''' 

 On that issue, and on the remaining big question of how the climate might change in the future, skeptics continue to differ sharply with the dominant view among climate experts. 

 The dominant view is that the surface warming is at least partly attributable to emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, a product of the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. A U.N. scientific panel has predicted that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of about 3.5 degrees, compared with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. This warming, the panel said, would touch off widespread disruptions in climate and weather and cause the global sea level to rise and flood many places. 

 Gray and others challenge all of this. To them, the observed surface warming of about 1 degree over the last century _ with an especially sharp rise in the last quarter century _ is mostly or wholly natural, and there is no significant human influence on global climate. They also adhere firmly to their long-held opinion that any future warming will be inconsequential or modest at most, and that its effects will largely be beneficial. 

 In some ways, though, adversaries in the debate are not so far apart. For instance, some dissenters say that future warming caused by greenhouse gases will be near the low end of the range predicted by the U.N. scientific panel. And most adherents of the dominant view readily acknowledge that the size of the human contribution to global warming is not yet known. 

 The thrust-and-parry of the climate debate goes on nevertheless. 

 With the National Research Council panel's conclusion that the surface warming is real, ``one of the key arguments of the contrarians has evaporated,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist with Environmental Defense, formerly the Environmental Defense Fund. 

 But those on the other side of the argument see things differently. 

 To them, the most important finding of the panel is its validation of satellite readings showing less warming, and maybe none, in parts of the upper atmosphere, said Dr. S. Fred Singer, an independent atmospheric scientist who is an outspoken dissenter. 

 For him and other climate dissenters, this disparity is key, in that it does not show up in computer models scientists use to predict future trends. The fact that these models apparently missed the difference in warming between the surface and the upper air, the skeptics say, casts doubt on their reliability overall. 

 Experts on all sides of the debate acknowledge that the climate models are imperfect, and even proponents of their use say their results should be interpreted cautiously. 

 A further problem is raised by the divergent temperatures at the surface and in the upper air, said Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is a foremost skeptic. ``Both are right,'' he said, but increasing levels of greenhouse gases should warm the entire troposphere (the lower 6 to 10 miles of the atmosphere). That they have not, he said, suggests that ``what's happening at the surface is not related to the greenhouse effect.'' 

 Skeptics also argue that the lower temperatures measured by the satellites are confirmed by instruments borne aloft by weather balloons. But over a longer period, going back 40 years, there is no discrepancy between surface readings and those obtained by the balloons, said Dr. John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was chairman of the research council study panel. 

 Although the climate debate has usually been portrayed as a polarized argument between believers and contrarians, there is actually a broad spectrum of views among scientists. And while the views of skeptics display some common themes, there are many degrees of dissent, many permutations and combinations of individual opinion. The views of some have changed materially over the years, while others have expressed essentially the same basic opinions all along. 

 One whose views have evolved is Wallace, who describes himself as ``more skeptical than most people'' but ``fairly open to arguments on both sides'' of the debate. He says the especially sharp surface warming trend of the 1990s has ``pulled me in a mainstream direction.'' While he once believed the warming observed in recent decades was just natural variation in climate, he said, he is now perhaps 80 percent sure that it has been induced by human activity _ ``but that's still a long way from being willing to stake my reputation on it.'' 

 nn 

 A decade ago, Wallace said, many skeptics questioned whether there even was a surface warming trend, in part because what now appears to be a century-long trend had been interrupted in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, and it had not yet resumed all that markedly. But the surge in the 1980s and 1990s changed the picture substantially. 

 Today, Wallace said, few appear to doubt that the earth's surface has warmed. One prominent dissenter on the greenhouse question, Dr. Robert Balling, a climatologist at Arizona State University, says, ``the surface temperatures appear to be rising, no doubt,'' and other skeptics agree. 

 There also appears to be general agreement that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are rising. At 360 parts per million, up from 315 parts in the late 1950s, the concentration of carbon dioxide is nearly 30 percent higher than before the Industrial Revolution, and the highest in the last 420,000 years. 

 Mainstream scientists, citing recent studies, suggest that the relatively rapid warming of the last 25 years cannot be explained without the greenhouse effect. Over that period, according federal scientists, the average surface temperature rose at a rate equivalent to about 3.5 degrees per century _ substantially more than the rise for the last century as a whole, and about what is predicted by computer models for the 21st century. 

 But many skeptics, including Gray and Singer, maintain that the warming of the past 25 years can be explained by natural causes, most likely changes in the circulation of heat-bearing ocean waters. In fact, Gray says he expects that over the next few decades, the warming will end and there will be a resumption of the cooling of the 1950s and 1960s. 

 At bottom, people on all sides of the debate agree, the question of the warming's cause has not yet been definitively answered. In December, a group of 11 experts on the question looked at the status of the continuing quest to detect the greenhouse signal amid the ``noise'' of the climate's natural variability. 

 The lead author of the study was Dr. Tim P. Barnett, a climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. Barnett, who has long worked on detecting the greenhouse signal, describes himself as a ``hard-nosed'' skeptic on that particular issue, even though he believes that global warming in the long run will be a serious problem. 

 The study by Barnett and others, published in The Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, concluded that the ``most probable cause'' of the observed warming had been a combination of natural and human-made factors. But they said scientists had not yet been able to separate the greenhouse signal from the natural climate fluctuations. This state of affairs, they wrote, ``is not satisfactory.'' 

 Two big questions complicate efforts to predict the course of the earth's climate over the next century: How sensitive is the climate system, inherently, to the warming effect of greenhouse gases? And how much will atmospheric levels of the gases rise over coming decades? 

 The mainstream view, based on computerized simulations of the climate system, is that a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations would produce a warming of about 3 to 8 degrees. But Lindzen and Gray, pointing to what they consider the models' problems with the physics of the atmosphere, say they overestimate possible warming. It ``will be extremely little,'' Gray said. How little? Lindzen pegs it at about half a degree to a bit less than 2 degrees, if atmospheric carbon dioxide doubles. 

 Other factors in the climate system modify the response to heat-trapping gases, and the U.N. panel's analysis included these to arrive at its projection of a 2- to 6-degree rise in the average global surface temperature by 2100. One factor is various possible levels of future carbon dioxide emissions. Singer, saying that improving energy efficiency will have a big impact on emissions, predicts a warming of less than 1 degree by 2100. 

 Balling projects a warming just shy of 1 degree for the next 50 years, not out of line with the U.N. panel's lower boundary. Another skeptic, Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist at the University of Virginia, similarly forecasts a greenhouse warming rise of 2.3 degrees over the next century. As is now the case, he says, the warming would be most pronounced in the winter, at night, and in sub-Arctic regions like Siberia and Alaska. A warming of that magnitude, he and others insist, could not be very harmful, and would in fact confer benefits like longer growing seasons and faster plant growth. 

 ``It should be pretty clear,'' he said, that the warming so far ``didn't demonstrably dent health and welfare very much,'' and he said he saw no reason ``to expect a sudden turnaround in the same over the next 50 years.'' After that, he said, it is impossible to predict the shape of the world's energy system and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions. 

 A warming in the low end of the range predicted by the U.N. panel may well materialize, said Oppenheimer, the environmentalist. But, he said, the high end may also materialize, in which case, mainstream scientists say, there would be serious, even catastrophic, consequences for human society. ``There is no compelling evidence to allow us to choose between the low end, or the high end, or the middle,'' Oppenheimer said. 

 If business continues as usual, the world is likely at some point to find out who is right.
