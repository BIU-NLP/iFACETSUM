BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Global warming will further aggravate the water shortage problem in North China as evaporation of river water will far exceed rainfall, reported a recent issue of the China Water Resources News. 

 The newspaper quoted scientist Ye Duzheng as saying that compared with the current level, the temperature will be increasing by 1.0-1.5 in winter by the year 2030, with rainfall remaining unchanged, while the summer temperature will witness a rise of 0.5-0.8 degrees Celsius, with rainfall edging up by 1-2 percent. 

 However, the rainfall that results from global warming will not be enough to make up the loss in river water, said the newspaper. 

 As a result, the flow in the Haihe and Luanhe rivers will drop by three to six percent from the present level. 

 Higher temperatures and severe water shortages will bring about a rise in winter wheat production, but a drop in spring wheat and corn. 

 Meanwhile, the changed climate is also threatening to expand the dry and arid area further north, forming a large sandy desert.
