BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to Mitch. Clouds grew. Rain squalls massed. And Tropical Depression No. 13 would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes. Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000 lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea. Powerful hurricanes like Mitch, devastating droughts and torrential floods have long plagued humankind. But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming. The two-week summit was expected to conclude Friday with a framework for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for reductions in heat-trapping gases by industrialized nations by 2012. Skeptics insist there's no way to predict the weather, next week, next decade or even a century from now. Environmentalists, too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming. In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.'' In other words, mankind has some hand in the Earth's warming. Picking up their cue from the scientific evidence, climate negotiators in Buenos Aires say there is more cause for concern. ``Every month so far this year has set a record high for global temperatures, right on the heels of 1997, the warmest year on the books. And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S. climate negotiator. Others reject that the globe is warming, and challenge the consensus that unfettered burning of coal, gas and oil will harm the Earth. As the debate continues, record amounts of gases spew from power plants and cars. New research shows that temperature changes can change more rapidly than previously thought, says Jeff Severinghause of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. ``We now have evidence that at the end of the last ice age, the climate warmed abruptly in less than 10 years,'' he said, reporting findings from 100-pound (45-kilo) samples extracted from Greenland's ice pack. He said evidence suggests a rapid change 11,600 years ago, when temperatures rose about 14 degrees F (8 degrees C) in a mere decade or two. He has documented at least one other sudden shift. One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R. Christy at the University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show significant global warming is not occuring now. He has also argued that trying to discern patterns in ``extreme'' weather events is misleading. And hurricane forecasters doubt extreme weather events such as Mitch show the influence of global warming. ``I think it's agreed that the globe is about 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer this century, but as far as its effect on tropical cyclones, we haven't been able to notice any difference,'' said forecaster Brian Jarvinen at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. He said intense hurricane periods have cycled on and off roughly every 25 years in this century. ``You had intense storms in the 1920s, 30s and 40s,'' he said, but then a milder hurricane cycle from the 60s to the 80s. Some governments warn they can't wait for a definitive answer to why the oceans are rising. Seas have risen 2 centimeters (nearly 1 inch) in the past year in parts of the Pacific, shrinking shorelines and displacing coastal dwellers _ all blamed on global warming. The prime minister of Tuvalu said his nation of 9,600 people _ spread over nine small South Pacific atolls, has already suffered. ``We are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries,'' said Bikenibeau Paeniu. ``We are spending millions of dollars to rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of climate change.'' As for global warming, he added his islands average just 2 meters (6 feet) above sea level, and global warming is ``not a matter of economics and politics, but of life and death.''
