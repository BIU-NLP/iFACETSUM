At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns. But one study by British and Italian scientists, reported recently in the journal Nature, examined data on atmospheric circulation over the last 50 years in the Northern Hemisphere. The researchers looked to see whether there had been any change in frequency of large-scale circulation regimes. The data revealed that there had: in recent decades, patterns had shifted to favor a warmer climate for most land areas in the Northern Hemisphere. 

 In a general warming of the globe, the air above those land areas would be expected to warm more than that above the oceans, because of differing abilities to absorb heat. But the authors of the new study postulate that the change in circulation patterns is the main reason the land has lately warmed so much. 

 That is, they say, the climate of the hemisphere shifts naturally back and forth between two dominant regimes. Both the North Atlantic and North Pacific oscillations are believed to be affected by this shift. But if some external influence imparts a warming or cooling impulse, the scientists say, the oscillation could be tipped in favor of one regime or the other. The external influence could be either natural, like a change in solar radiation, or artificial, like carbon dioxide emissions. 

 ``What we're saying is that you can understand much of the observed climate change in terms of that picture,'' said Dr. Tim Palmer, a climatologist at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England, and one of the study's authors. While the study does not prove that human-induced global warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation patterns, he said, the change is consistent with it. 

 Such global warming would not produce new types of weather patterns, he said, but it would change the probability of occurrence of existing ones, Palmer said. And differing regional patterns of warming are a direct consequence of that, he said. 

 Another oscillation, in the Arctic, involves the strength of high-altitude winds that circle the North Pole near the Arctic Circle. The winds oscillate between stronger and weaker states, with consequences for weather and climate farther south. Some experts believe that the Arctic oscillation is being altered by global warming. 

 The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions. This would increase the temperature contrast between the two regions and thereby strengthen the pole-girdling vortex of winds. This, according to the new thinking, would in turn strengthen westerly winds off the Atlantic, making northern Eurasia warmer and wetter. 

 Some scientists, like Dr. John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, think that the Arctic and North Atlantic oscillations are so closely tied together as to be the same thing. The effects of the Arctic oscillation over the North Pacific, he said, are more subtle. ``It's hard to see them clearly,'' he said, ``because another big thing is going on there; that's the variability related to El Nino.'' 

 The El Nino-La Nina cycle is the strongest year-to-year natural climatic oscillation. The two alternating states have markedly different effects on weather. In a strong El Nino, for instance, prevailing jet-stream winds slam into the southern tier of the United States, producing floods, mudslides and tornadoes. In La Nina, the central United States typically gets very cold weather as well as tornadoes, while much of the East is warm and tranquil. 

 Historically, El Nino has appeared every two to seven years, with La Nina showing up less often. But over the last two decades, El Nino has appeared more frequently than before, and in much of the 1990s it seemed to go on more or less continuously. Could this be related to global warming? 

 A number of scientists have raised the possibility. Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has postulated that the time interval between El Nino visitations depends on how long it takes to recharge the tropical system by re-accumulating heat at the sea surface. Global warming, he suggests, may enable the system to recharge more rapidly, thereby making El Nino appear more often. 

 Another study reported recently in Nature appeared to lend some credence to this view. The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency. In the past, these climate models have been unable to simulate the behavior of the tropical Pacific finely enough to address the issue. 

 The Max Planck researchers said they had overcome that problem, and their computer simulation produced more frequent El Nino conditions as well as more powerful La Nina events. 

 None of this constitutes anything remotely approaching a last word on the response of the climate system's natural churnings to global warming. But as Wallace says, experts have begun focusing on responses ``that look like distortions of natural patterns.'' 

 All those patterns are part of a single, integrated climate system, and scientists are just beginning to zero in on how they relate to one another in the context of a warming atmosphere. 

 That task only makes the problem of climate change more complicated than ever. &QL;
