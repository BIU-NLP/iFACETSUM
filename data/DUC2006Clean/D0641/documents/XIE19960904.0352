NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An American biologist has obtained the clearest evidence so far that global warming is forcing living species to move toward the poles and to higher altitudes, according to the New York Times today. 

 Experts have long predicted that many organisms would shift their ranges in response to climatic change. But good evidence of such movement in response to the modest warming of the last century has been lacking. 

 The clearest evidence was found by Dr. Camille Parmesan, a researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She drove 45,000 miles and lived in a tent for 14 months in the summers of 1992 through 1994. She made on-the-spot survey of more than 100 previously recorded populations of the butterfly from Mexico to Canada and eastward to Colorado. 

 By comparing what she found with previous records, she discovered a pattern of local extinctions and colonizations that taken together, documented the northward movement of the species. 

 She said that the shift is surprisingly large for the relatively small average warming of the earth's surface, about one degree Fahrenheit, over the last century. So, she concluded that warming is the cause of the change. 

 Biologists say that the warming of the earth's surface over the last century has probably been caused by emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases. They predicted that the warming will continue most likely amounting to about 3.5 degrees by the end of the next century if emissions are not reduced. The predicted warming is expected to cause widespread climatic, ecological and economic dislocation.
