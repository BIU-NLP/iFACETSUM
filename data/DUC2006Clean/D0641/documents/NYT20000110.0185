SAN ANTONIO _ Environmental and religious groups are trying to force ExxonMobil to admit that the world is getting hotter and that people and industry are to blame. 

 ``They continue to deny that global warming is happening,'' said Peter Altman, national coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil, an organization recently formed by about 40 environmental and religious groups. 

 The goal of the campaign is to persuade the nation's largest oil company to withdraw from an industry group Altman contends is trying to undermine acceptance of an international agreement that would require industrialized nations to reduce emissions contributing to global warming. 

 ``They've been very successful in delaying policies that would help us,'' Altman said of both ExxonMobil and the Global Climate Coalition, which was formed and funded by ExxonMobil and other business interests to raise questions about global warming. 

 Tom Cirigliano, a spokesman for ExxonMobil in Dallas, said the company recognizes ``the potential for climate change'' but questions its cause and the wisdom of signing the international agreement, known as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. 

 Negotiators hope to reach final agreement next year on the treaty. Under the agreement, developed nations may be able to buy or trade pollution credits with less developed countries. 

 ``We don't believe the current scientific understanding justifies mandating a reduction in the use of fossil fuels,'' Cirigliano said. 

 He also said ``large economic harm would result from reductions in fuel available to consumers by the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol.'' 

 Gerald North, head of the atmospheric sciences department at Texas A&M University, said the majority of scientists agree that the Earth's average temperature rose by at least 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 1900s and is expected to rise even more in the 21st century.

 ``I do think there is a pretty broad consensus that we are already seeing the warming, that man is the cause and that there will probably be another three to five degrees of warming,'' said North, who considers himself a moderate on the issue. 

 The Environmental Protection Agency says that the energy burned to run automobiles, and to heat homes and businesses, contributes to global warming. The EPA says there has been a dramatic increase in atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide. 

 North said the effect of global warming in Texas and the projected corresponding 1-to-2-foot rise in the sea level could add additional stress on already tight water supplies. 

 It also could cause an increase in heat-related fatalities, as well as the loss of beach, coastal habitat and fisheries, he said. 

 ``It's not necessarily the end of the world,'' North said. ``People are fairly adaptable. There will be irreversible change. There's no doubt about that.'' 

 Altman said the campaign seeks to pressure ExxonMobil board members to follow Ford Motor Co.'s lead and withdraw from the Global Climate Coalition, which he claimed confuses the public and policymakers about the facts of global warming. 

 Glenn Kelly, the executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, acknowledged his group represents businesses and companies with a stake in how the climate issue is resolved, but he defended its positions and statements. 

 ``There are many sides to the ongoing debate, and I think it's disingenuous to suggest that just because we have a different view of the climate that it's somehow a misinformation campaign,'' Kelly said. 

 Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming. 

 North, however, said he has reservations about the group's work. 

 ``I think they're trying to protect industry, and they certainly have a right to do so, but I think there's a certain amount of dishonesty in their statements,'' he said. ``I think they belittle scientists in the process, which is something I don't like.'' 

 The Sisters of the Holy Spirit, best known for its work with teen mothers at the Healy-Murphy Center in San Antonio, also is involved in Campaign ExxonMobil. 

 Sister Gabriella Lohan, the Sisters' general treasurer, said she is optimistic that the oil company eventually will warm to the campaign's position because religious groups have hundreds of millions of dollars to invest and their congregations include millions of people. 

 ``It's slow work, but we get it done,'' she said.
