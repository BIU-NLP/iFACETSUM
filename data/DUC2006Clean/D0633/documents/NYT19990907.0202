FORT WORTH, Texas _ By the end of September, the warnings will be up on billboards all over this Texas city: ``Gun Crime Means Hard Time.'' 

 In Richmond, Va, the signs carry this message: ``An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison.'' 

 In Rochester, N.Y., you might read a similar warning on the side of a city bus: ``You (plus) illegal gun (equals) federal prison.'' 

 Behind the tough messages is a new approach to curbing gun violence that is being adopted by cities around the country, where officials are eager to duplicate the apparent success of Richmond's 2-year-old ``Project Exile.'' 

 Criminals who ignore the advertised warnings and tote guns face tough, specialized federal prosecution instead of getting lost in the overwhelmed state courts. 

 In each city, they're selling a promise that if you're caught carrying a weapon in the commission of a crime, the local authorities will turn you over to the feds, who will use existing law to seek out the longest sentence applicable for your offense. A convicted felon caught with a gun or anyone caught carrying a gun while trafficking in drugs will usually draw at least five years in a federal penitentiary. 

 In the federal system, repeat offenders get more time, federal prisoners serve about 80 percent of their sentences and there is no parole. 

 ``There's been a sea change in the criminal community,'' says James B.Comey, criminal division chief in Richmond's U.S. attorney's office. ``The bad guys say exactly the same thing: `Hey man, nobody's carrying any more. That thing will get you five years.''' 

 Richmond had the second-highest murder rate in the country in 1997, the year they mounted Project Exile. They ended the year with 140 homicides, but by the end of 1998 that number had dropped to 94. The city has recorded only 47 homicides through the first eight months of this year, as compared to 67 for the same time period last year. 

 ``I tell you what it's done,'' Comey said. ``Richmond was a demoralized city, not just in the folks who live here but in the police department. 

 ``Exile gets more credit than it deserves some times, but it's fired up the cops and fired up the citizens,'' Comey said. ``We are doing something. We are becoming a zero-tolerance city for guns.'' 

 Because the program doesn't require new gun laws, and is not gun control in the traditional sense, even the National Rifle Association is supporting Project Exile. That makes it a rare animal _ a gun program that President Clinton, Sarah Brady and the NRA can agree on. 

 ``I wish (the Clinton administration) backed this more than the lip service they've given it,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ``Call it whatever you want, but whatever effort goes after armed violent felons on the streets of American cities is something the NRA backs heartily.'' 

 Civic leaders are desperate to reduce gun violence in their communities. Even though the murder rate has fallen dramatically in most major cities in recent years, traveling to Richmond to study Project Exile is becoming a civic leader's pilgrimage to Mecca. 

 ``There really isn't any rocket science to doing a lot of gun cases,'' says Comey. ``The genius to Exile is the advertising, because what that has done is sell fear to the potential defendants in ways we never imagined. 

 ``It really almost creates a myth in Richmond,'' Comey said. ``The advertising people said, `Look, we manipulate culture.' They said, `Give us a chance to sell fear.''' 

 Word of mouth has been important, too, Comey said. 

 ``Bug Smith was a legendary shooter in Richmond. We popped him with a single gun and he got 16 1/2 years in the fed. When the word got out that Bug Smith got 16 1/2 years on a gun, the reaction was just phenomenal.'' 

 Comey quickly agrees there are other factors at play in Richmond that may have affected the murder rate. 

 For instance, Virginia abolished parole in 1994, which means the first wave of criminals put away since then are probably not yet back on the streets. And the drug trade in his city has shifted away from crack cocaine to heroin, which produces less volatile behavior, Comey said. 

 But all the decreases in homicides in Richmond have been in the category of murders by firearm. And there's been a nearly identical drop in armed robberies. 

 ``Those two clues tell me something has happened in the firearm world of bad guys in Richmond,'' Comey said. 

 But the approach has its critics. 

 Three U.S. District judges have lambasted Project Exile for crossing the line ``into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility.'' Federal prosecution also costs considerably more than state prosecution of similar cases. 

 And in Richmond, criminal attorney David Baugh charges that Project Exile violates the civil rights of Richmond's black residents by sending them in front of federal juries drawn from a larger, predominantly white pool. Federal officials point out, however, that most Project Exile offenders will never see a jury, opting to plea bargain. 

 The 10th Amendment to the constitution was written to make sure the federal government did not intrude upon those responsibilities held by the states, Baugh said, ``And now we have every case, and it's momma being handled by the feds. The federal courts are overcrowded anyway _ judges who are supposed to be handling the most delicate cases are now doing the equivalent of traffic cases.'' 

 Fort Worth's ``Operation Safe City'' will work much like Richmond's program, as a cooperative approach among the local police department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S. attorney's office. On a recent afternoon, ATF agent Mike Russell delivered his pitch for the program to more than 100 of Fort Worth's Neighborhood Police Officers. 

 He made it clear that the gun cases will be prosecuted strictly off the arrest reports filed by the local police. 

 ``The success of this program is directly proportional to getting these guys prosecuted in the federal system,'' Russell said. ``It's a gimme, folks. The U.S. attorney doesn't want cases where we have to come back and interview people. These cases will be made strictly off the reports you file.'' 

 Their best chance for making a gun case stick is at the point of executing the search warrant, he said, advising them to write down as much detail as possible about where the gun was found and any comments the suspect makes about the gun. 

 ``They may not tell you about the dope,'' Russell said. But the gun? 

 ``You're not the gun police, we are,'' Russell said. ``You talk to them then and they'll probably tell you anything you want to know.'' 

 Several Fort Worth officers immediately began asking questions about using the program to get people off the streets who are problems in their neighborhoods. When Russell got back to his office, he had a handful of telephone messages from officers who had specific cases they wanted to pass on for federal prosecution. 

 Russell has been operating something of a one-man ``Safe City U.S.A.'' program for the past 18 months, wading through Fort Worth Police Department offense reports and pursuing those gun cases he thought he could make stick. 

 Russell picked up one gun case from an offense report on a man arrested for multiple traffic warrants. A patrol officer spotted a motorcycle parked between two houses in a residential neighborhood late at night, and saw a shortened, pistol-grip shotgun strapped to the bike. The officer ran the motorcycle's license tag number, and discovered the outstanding traffic warrants. 

 The officer arrested Nicholas Alexander Martin when he returned to the bike a few minutes later, dressed in black, a bandolier of shotgun shells strapped to his chest. He was also carrying a flashlight, four feet of telephone cord, a four-inch lock-blade knife and white surgical gloves. There was a ski mask in his pocket. 

 ``We picked up the (gun) case, and he turned out to be a multiconvicted felon in possession of a firearm,'' Russell said. Martin got 17 1/2 years in the federal penitentiary. 

 David Montague, a spokesman in the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, said Martin probably would have been allowed to plead guilty to 10 years or less had the case stayed in the state system. And with good time and parole, he would serve even less. 

 ``The reality is that in the state courts, we have so many murders, armed robberies, child abusers and sex offenders that it's unlikely he would have the maximum,'' Montague said. 

 When the Safe City program formally kicks off at the end of the month, Russell will be aided by six other ATF agents in researching gun cases for prosecution. ``When this thing gets rolling, we're talking about volume,'' he said. 

 Volume has been a problem in Richmond, where federal prosecutors saw their felony caseload jump from about 139 in 1996 to 404 in 1998 as a result of Project Exile. The Justice Department is requesting an additional $5 million from Congress to fund about 45 to 50 prosecutors to help with the increased gun enforcement through a variety of programs. 

 The NRA is lobbying Congress for $50 million to implement Project Exile or something like it in every major city. 

 In Fort Worth, the public relations campaign designed to make criminals leave their guns at home is being financed by local businessmen Perry and Lee Bass. 

 Fort Worth is not reeling under its homicide rate. 

 In 1991, considered the city's worst year for violent crime, there were 195 homicides. But by 1998 there were only 64, and Fort Worth's violent crime rate dropped more in the past two years than Richmond's under Project Exile. 

 ``What better time than when life is good?'' said Fort Worth assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Moore. ``I came to the U.S. attorney's office from the district attorney's office. I was the gang queen. I didn't try anything but murders and capital murders. It was all guns. 

 ``I'm excited about bearing down on criminals with guns because I don't want to go back to those days,'' Moore said. ``If I can take a gun away from one criminal and one person doesn't get shot or killed, man, I feel great! How do you measure that?''
