RICHMOND, Va. _ Here on the streets of Virginia's capital, Melvin Douglas Smith was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking. For all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade, from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder, none stuck. He never served a day in prison. 

 Then Smith's luck ran out. When a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in 1997, the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing: Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called Project Exile, prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the tougher federal system. He is now serving 16 and a half years in a federal prison. 

 As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets, Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system, where bond is less available, sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms. 

 Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in Richmond, but it has also brought together officials from other cities and the National Rifle Association in an expanding experiment to see whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws already on the books, rather than fighting over new laws. 

 While the Justice Department, long an adversary of the rifle association over gun control, has held back from recommending Project Exile as a cure-all, and a panel of federal judges in Richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters, Philadelphia and Rochester, N.Y., have adopted versions of the program, and more than a dozen other cities are considering it. 

 While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a variety of reasons, the authorities in Richmond contend that Project Exile helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36 percent last year, to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997, one of the steepest declines in any city. 

 The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases. Once Smith was sentenced, for example, witnesses no longer afraid of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six murders, including two that could bring the death penalty. 

 ``In Richmond, there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community,'' Mayor Timothy M. Kaine said. ``High crime has been our psychological downer. But Project Exile is driving the crime rate down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believers again.'' 

 Patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug activities, the program evolved from a determination to prosecute gun charges in federal courts, where the stakes are higher for defendants than in state courts, even though federal courts generally regard gun violations as low-level crimes. 

 Many gun offenses become federal as well as state crimes when they are coupled with other offenses like drug possession or when the person arrested is a convicted felon, an illegal alien, a mental patient, a drug addict, a fugitive, the subject of a criminal indictment or a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. 

 As a key element of Project Exile, a coalition of business and civic leaders has cooperated with the police by saturating the area with radio and television messages, billboards and posters, warning that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five years. 

 Project Exile is so well known on the street, said David E. Boone, a criminal defense lawyer here, that ``the first thing I hear now when I talk to a client is, `Can you keep this from going Exile?' A lot of them can't add two and two, but they know a gun plus drugs equals five.'' 

 Some do, anyway. S. David Schiller, an assistant U.S. attorney here who conceived the program, said the first two years of Project Exile have led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns, indictments against 404 people on gun charges, a conviction rate of 86 percent through trials and plea bargains, and an average prison term of more than four and a half years. 

 And Richmond police officers say the program is convincing some would-be criminals to leave their weapons at home. ``We're now finding more guns in houses than on the street,'' said Michael J. Shamus, an acting lieutenant on the police department's Rapid Mobilization Team. ``The streets are safer.'' 

 Still, not everyone is convinced that Project Exile is the appropriate means to attack the gun problem. In a recent court ruling, all three judges of the federal District Court here criticized the program as ``a substantial federal incursion into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility.'' 

 And the Justice Department has remained reluctant to promote it as a national solution to gun violence. 

 Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that department officials ``take issue with the notion that there is a cookie-cutter approach to reducing gun violence'' and added, ``Exile worked in Richmond and can work in other places, but you have to look at the local situation, the situation in every city, to decide exactly what will work.'' 

 Holder also said the department had sent additional federal marshals, agents and prosecutors ``to make Exile a successful program.''
