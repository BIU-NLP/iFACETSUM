NEW YORK _ It was a slow news day in the depths of summer. Thirteen Ohio factory workers had won a $296 million lottery. The Hamptons were gearing up for a visit by the Clintons. 

 WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different story to lead its 6 p.m. newscast on July 30: Seven women had been harassed over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester County. Once, a man fondled himself as a woman passed by. Several other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the women, the station reported. 

 Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even sure if they had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem an odd choice as the top news in the nation's largest city. In the early 1990s, when the New York crime rate was much higher, the report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast, much less lead it. 

 The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years. The crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on sexual attacks and child abuse. There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself, including police misconduct. 

 But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _ particularly in New York City's three major daily newspapers _ where change is most pronounced. In the first two weeks of May 1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times. In the first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as many articles about crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether, including several on crimes in the suburbs. On many days in May, there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post, where once it was a staple. 

 On local television news, which has been criticized for years for its daily diet of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a reduction as well, though much more modest. It is impossible to quantify, because news directors at New York's major network-owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of old broadcasts. 

 There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news four or more years ago. But many current and former television news executives say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were about crime. The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer, and crime was the subject of 27 percent of the reports. 

 On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on local news shows, and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them. But on other nights, crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows. 

 These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York, where the number of killings has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year. At the current rate, there would be fewer than 600 this year, the lowest total in three decades. 

 Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions, especially by people who manage local television news operations, to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports. ``There is a positive feeling overall, and I think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all live in the same community,'' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey. ``We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live.'' 

 Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of police department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and access to police officials. 

 Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a day in New York City, on average, the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover. There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police Department as an institution. Crime news often crowded out other subjects on television. 

 ``Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage,'' said Bart Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV. ``This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting and diverse way. I think there is more commitment at all the stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to honest-to-goodness journalism.'' 

 Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view. But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary. 

 Some nights, local stations compensate for the murder gap by covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that, not long ago, would have passed unnoticed. 

 A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter road rage. Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold, N.J., accused of stabbing his wife, a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx motel and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J. 

 But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags. 

 On Aug. 28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market's slide might affect New York City's budget. The previous week, a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.

 Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on local television. ``There's no question that it is still the predominant item,'' said David Klatell, head of the broadcast program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. ``Television news has always been a much more emotive and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime persists even if the reality doesn't. It's much easier to cover crime than to cover the school system or race relations.'' 

 Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the content of local television news two years ago. They analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the 1996-1997 television season. The survey showed that 27.2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime, well above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent. A similar analysis of the television season that ended last spring is not finished. 

 Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news cable station, with influencing coverage on the larger network-owned stations. Since it started in 1992, NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods. 

 Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said that his station was devoting less time to crime these days. ``Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the day,'' he said, ``the police reporter is now more likely to be covering police department issues.'' 

 Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react more strongly to major crimes. The decline in crime means that ``those that do occur take on a prominence, seem more newsworthy than they did in the past,'' said Daily News managing editor Arthur Browne. ``There is an added shock value now when they happen.'' 

 Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are generally less cooperative. Some police reporters said that they could usually get enough information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other enterprise articles. 

 ``This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad news out of the papers and off the screen,'' said Gabe Pressman, the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York Press Club. 

 Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news in the city's papers is startling. On May 4, for example, there was a single crime article in The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a 13-year-old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range. The Times, in its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a sexual abuse case in Syracuse. The following day, there were no reports on crime in The News, The Times or The Post. &QL; 

 On May 6, there was one article in The Post, on page 7, about the arrest of a substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting students with a chair. The News put the same story on page 8, next to an article about an investigation into whether police officers had covered up for an off-duty detective involved in a car crash. The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1. 

 That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of ``Seinfeld.'' 

 ``There are really two possible explanations for this,'' said Mitchell Stephens, acting chairman of the journalism department at New York University. ``One is that the reality has changed and news reflects reality. I tend to doubt that. The other is that competitive organizational pressures in the news business are responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage.'' 

 Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called ``The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word,'' said the arrival of New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in the city. In time-honored American fashion, he said, newspapers sought circulation by concentrating on crime. The death of New York Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on editors to pursue crime. 

 Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished attention to crime by the New York news organizations. ``Maybe people are feeling less paranoid,'' he said, ``and it is harder to push those buttons.''
