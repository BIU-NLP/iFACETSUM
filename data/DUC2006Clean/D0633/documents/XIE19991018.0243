WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in the United States declined in 1998 for the seventh straight year, with the murder and robbery rates being the lowest in three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Sunday. 

 The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level since 1985, according to the report. 

 The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989, the FBI said. 

 A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder every 31 minutes, but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967. 

 Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to "more police officers on the street, greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision." 

 "This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can indeed turn the tide on crime," President Bill Clinton said in a statement. But he cautioned that "even as crime falls, we must not let down our guard. That is why we must redouble our efforts to build on what works." 

 The report also said firearms were used in 64.9 percent of murders. Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported used in the killings.
