WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered his government Saturday to develop a plan for closer federal-state cooperation to increase prosecution of criminals who use firearms and to take other steps aimed at reducing gun violence. 

 In his weekly radio address, Clinton claimed the country's crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent since 1993, and the rate of murders by firearms has fallen by 33 percent. But he said that far too many people still are killed by guns. In 1997, 14,000 people were killed by guns. 

 "Guns have magnified the malevolence of crime," Clinton said, adding that disarming criminals should be the top priority. 

 Clinton put Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno in charge of developing a strategy against gun violence. 

 He singled out Project Exile, headed by the U.S. attorney in Richmond in cooperation with state, local and other federal officials. 

 Clinton said hundreds of firearms have been seized and hundreds of criminals who used firearms convicted. The key to the project, he said, is using existing federal laws as the backbone of the enforcement effort. 

 Clinton repeated what his budget for the next fiscal year is proposing to help cut firearm-related crime, including 5 million U.S. dollars for dozens of new federal prosecutors and 23.8 million dollars for more than 120 new agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
