ALBANY, N.Y. _ Borrowing from a crime-fighting tool used in New York City, Gov. George Pataki has announced a pilot program designed to help counties share crime data, map trends and nab more criminals. 

 The program is modeled after New York City's successful Comstat system, which turns dry crime statistics into maps of criminal hot spots. Within a year, the state hopes to institute a similar data-sharing system among 10 counties, with the hope that this will help the police agencies map county-to-county trends, share resources and confront crime more effectively. Officials hope to expand the program statewide by 1999. 

 ``Criminals don't abide by jurisdictional borders,'' Pataki, Republican, said in announcing the program Monday. The pilot program includes the counties that comprise the State Police Troop G area, including Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties. 

 New York City's crime rate has plummeted during the time it has been using the Comstat tracking system, fueling a statistical drop in crime statewide. Murders dropped by 44 percent statewide between 1995 and 1997 and rapes have declined 15 percent, according to projections made by the Department of Criminal Justice Services. 

 But not all counties have seen such a dramatic drop. In Rensselaer County, for example, violent crime increased 33 percent between 1992 and 1996. Between 1996 and 1997, it jumped another 6 percent, according to the most recent statewide statistics. 

 The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they fear that as New York City's crime rate drops, criminals move northward, where drugs fetch higher prices. 

 In 1996, for example, 1,226 of the suspects arrested in Albany said they were born in New York City, up from 644 in 1991, city records show. A kilo of heroin that sells for as little as $75,000 in New York City can trade for as much as $180,000 in the Albany area. 

 ``There's no doubt that we do get some crime from New York City,'' said Albany Police Chief Kevin Tuffey, adding that the problem of dealing with the criminal commute north was the subject of a law enforcement seminar held two weeks ago in New York City. ``That's what this will help us to track.'' 

 The Pataki administration's pilot program is called the Crime Analysis Partnerships to Upgrade Regional Enforcement, or CAPTURE. 

 The CAPTURE system, which will cost an estimated $500,000 to start, will enable the police in one area to tap into a program that will tell them if the police in another jurisdiction have encountered a similar crime pattern. 

 ``They (criminals) are moving in the direction of least resistance,'' said Deputy Chief Jack Nielsen of the Albany Police Department. ``This will help tell us where to shore up.'' 

 The details are still being worked out. But the program may require the state to equip the smaller policing agencies with a computer or a fax machine enabling them to provide data to the state on a weekly or biweekly basis.
