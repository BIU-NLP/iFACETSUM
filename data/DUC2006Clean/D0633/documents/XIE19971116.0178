WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Violent crimes fell 10 percent in 1996 in the United States, says an annual U.S. Justice Department survey of victims released Saturday. 

 The overall victimization rates from all crimes were at their lowest level since the survey of victims began 23 years ago, the survey said, 

 The 1996 violent crime rate against victims was down 16 percent from 1993. Property crime was down 8 percent last year, and was 17 percent lower than 1993. 

 Other crimes against persons, including rape, attempted rape, other sexual assaults and aggravated assaults, also were down dramatically during the 1993-96 period. 

 Likewise, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, personal theft such as purse snatching fell 19 percent, 29 percent, 35 percent respectively. 

 There were an estimated 2.7 million "completed'' violent crimes in 1996, for a rate of 12.4 per 1,000 U.S. residents 12 years or older. In contrast, there were 3 million in 1995, a rate of 13.8. 

 Property crimes and attempts dropped from 29.5 million, or 291 per 1000 households, to 27.4 million, or 266 per 1000 households. 

 The Bureau of Justice Statistics says the victims' survey is in general agreement with the FBI figures released last September.
