CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago is the nation's 1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide. 

 Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide totals for the first time ever. New York has seen a dramatic drop in its homicides. There were 629 there last year, compared with a 1990 high of 2,262. 

 When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more than double that of New York. 

 The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop in murders. There were 759 murders there in 1997. The last year murders numbered less than 700 was 1988, when there were 663. 

 ``One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the numbers go down,'' Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said. 

 He credited the city's community policing program for much of the decline. But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. 

 Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities. In that same period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent. 

 ``It is upsetting and very disturbing that we have now passed New York City in the number of murders...,'' said Arthur Lurigio, chairman of the criminal justice department at Loyola University. ``I am at a loss as to why Chicago's reductions are not commensurate to other large cities.'' 

 Poverty levels in Chicago could account for some of the statistics, said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston. 

 Meanwhile, Chicago police officials hope their efforts will eventually pay off. 

 ``We are making a long-term investment in our communities, making them places where neighbors feel safe and criminals feel unwelcome,'' Chicago Police Supt. Terry Hillard said. ``This process may take a little longer, but the long-term rewards are great -- steadily declining crime rates and increased quality of life.''
