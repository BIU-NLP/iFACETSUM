If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in the United States. That is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were executed in Florida and Georgia. 

 Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned juvenile offenders _ those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976. 

 The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States. While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated. Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama. 

 In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18. 

 ``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty.'' 

 But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were, according to most laws, still children when they committed their crimes. The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions, according to the State Department. Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties, including the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified. 

 The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in a 1989 ruling. The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions. No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed. Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma. 

 Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders. Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994. Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year. Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993. 

 In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned juvenile offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was white and female. The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls. They were all between the ages of 17 and 19 when they were electrocuted. 

 While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S. State Department, the U.N. High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo. 

 The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty International. 

 Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya. 

 Besides the prohibition in the U.N. convention, the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The U.S. Senate voted to ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders. 

 The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647, said Victor Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty, and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University. 

 Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime. 

 The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor. 

 Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years. 

 Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated. 

 Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness. 

 But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently. 

 ``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant manager in Mobile, Ala., in 1989. ``Gary Hart is a predator.''
