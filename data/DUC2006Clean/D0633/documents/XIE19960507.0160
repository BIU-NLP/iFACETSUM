WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At a time when the opening of the 1996 summer Olympic Games is drawing, the host city, Atlant, was rated as the most violent city in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics. 

 The FBI figures revealed Sunday show that while crime nationwide fell 2 percent in 1995, crime in Atlanta rose 4 percent in the year. The figures make Atlanta's crime rate the highest among U.S. cities of 250,000 or more people. It topped the rankings in both violent and non-violent crime. 

 However, officials from the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) said, "This is not representative of a lack of preparation for the Olympic Games." 

 "If people who come here will follow instructions, I think they'll be in the most secure place on Earth," said A.D. Frazier, chief operating officer of the ACOG. 

 ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the Games, with more than 25,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers and military personnel. They will be assisted by thousands of agents from the FBI, CIA and other secret services. 

 In preparation for the worst, security forces held a series of anti-terrorism exercises in the city last month, and law enforcement officers uncovered a underground bomb factory in central Georgia and arrested two men. 

 Reports said that ACOG security officials have travelled to foreign countries to get advice on anti-terrorist tactics.
