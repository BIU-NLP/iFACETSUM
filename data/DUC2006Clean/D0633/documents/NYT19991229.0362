WASHINGTON _ Six years after stepping down as New York City's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly finds himself playing cop again _ this time as commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, with a mission that includes tracking down terrorists who might try to cross the borders in time for this week's millennium celebrations. 

 ``It feels like I never really left the beat,'' said Kelly, who ran the New York City Police Department when terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, the last deadly attack by foreign terrorists on American soil. 

 In the last few weeks, the Customs Service seems to have proved that the potential millennium threat is real. On Dec. 14, customs inspectors arrested an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, as he crossed from Canada into Washington state. Prosecutors said his car was packed with a nitroglycerine-like chemical and other bomb-making components; he had a reservation at a motel in Seattle near the Space Needle. 

 Seattle officials later canceled the public celebration there because of security concerns. And five days after Ressam's arrest, customs agents in Vermont detained two people who have since been tied by prosecutors to Algerian militant groups. 

 Kelly speaks somberly of what the arrests might suggest. ``We've got to be concerned,'' he said, his stocky, compact frame and thick New York accent bringing Jimmy Cagney to mind. ``I think you've got to be realistic. You can't sugarcoat.'' 

 Kelly knows what terrorists bent on slaughter can do. He recalled rushing to the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, when a bomb unleashed a fireball, killing six people and leaving a seven-story crater where a parking garage had been. ``The thing I remember most vividly,'' he said, ``was looking down and seeing this hole, this huge hole.'' 

 But every so often, the solemnity in Kelly's voice gives way to his obvious excitement at how the Customs Service, among the least glamorous of law enforcement agencies, has found itself on the front lines of the war against terrorism. ``Yes, absolutely, I feel energized, invigorated,'' he said. He is convinced that the professionalism of his agents in Washington state prevented a terrorist attack. ``There's no question about it. They're heroes.'' 

 The arrest prompted President Clinton to announce a heightened state of alert for federal law enforcement agencies. In the last two weeks, Kelly has added 500 inspectors to border stations. ``Will there be more searches? Yes,'' he said. ``Will there be more interviews with people? Yes. Are there going to be some delays? Yes.'' 

 This whirlwind of excitement is a reminder of why he told Clinton last year that he wanted to run the Customs Service. It was technically a demotion from his last job, as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for enforcement, a post in which he supervised not only the Customs Service but also the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 

 ``It was a step down, but it was an inside-the-beltway step down,'' he said. ``Undersecretary was a policy job, and that's fine, and I enjoyed it. But this is more fun. This is a law enforcement organization. I feel more comfortable here. I'm much more comfortable here.'' 

 There were worries earlier this year that Kelly might have to cut short his tenure. In June, he had a heart bypass operation. ``This was a shock to me,'' said Kelly, a 58-year-old Marine Corps veteran who always prided himself on staying in shape. He was back at work within days of the surgery and has resumed his daily visits to the gym in his condominium complex, spending 40 minutes on a treadmill before hitting the weights. 

 As New York's police commissioner, Kelly had a resume drawn up by central casting. The youngest of five children, he was raised in a building at Columbus Avenue and 91st Street in Manhattan _ ``It's now a McDonald's,'' he says with a sigh _ before moving to Queens as a teen-ager. His father, a milkman, later worked for the Internal Revenue Service. His one sister worked in the fashion industry before retiring. Like his three brothers, Kelly joined the Marines. 

 He returned to civilian life after fighting in Vietnam. While working in the stockroom in the baby clothes department at Macy's, Kelly saw a recruiting ad for the police. He registered at the Police Academy, graduating first in a class of 1,800. 

 His tenure as police commissioner was brief _ only 18 months _ but Kelly was praised for his performance, both for the overall decline in the crime rate and for his sensitivity to racial concerns. Jimmy Breslin, the newspaper columnist, described him as ``a city treasure.'' 

 Kelly said he had long wondered what else he might have accomplished had Mayor Rudolph Giuliani not decided, shortly after his election in November 1993, to find a new commissioner. ``Giuliani had the absolute right to pick his own police commissioner,'' he said. ``But crime was down every day on my watch.'' 

 He still sees plenty of New York, where his wife, who sells medical equipment, lives in their apartment in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan. ``We have a commuting deal, and she'll come down to Washington virtually every weekend if I don't go up,'' he said. He is always glad to go up. ``I'm a New Yorker,'' he said. ``That's my home.''
