WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders, nervous about possible anti-homosexual remarks during floor debate on anti-gay legislation, said Thursday that they have devised a strategy to smother any fiery rhetoric on the issue. 

 They hope to convert the debate over an anti-gay proposal into a dignified discussion about presidential powers. And they will limit the entire debate to 20 minutes. 

 The touchy legislation, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., would nullify an executive order issued in May by President Clinton that bars federal agencies from discriminating against gays. 

 The Republican leadership in the House has combined the Hefley proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local governments. 

 The result: a dry-as-dust constitutional debate about states rights rather than a potentially emotional confrontation over the hot-button issue of gay rights. The planned debate is expected as early as Monday. 

 Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual, said the brevity of the scheduled debate ``shows how embarrassed (the Republicans) are by this.'' 

 ``This is a very oppressive, outrageous and undemocratic way to talk about things,'' Frank said. 

 But Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who said it was his idea to blur the debate over Hefley's amendment, said 20 minutes of debate was more than enough time. 

 ``I think five minutes is plenty on this issue,'' Linder said. 

 As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee responsible for helping elect House Republicans this November, Linder said he ``did not want to see a debate on the floor over the gay issue.'' 

 ``I'm hoping to see the debate be on the broader issue of executive orders,'' Linder said. 

 Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only openly gay House Republican, agreed with Linder that an all-out debate on gay rights made him squeamish. 

 Koble said he was ``not anxious for a long debate on this.'' 

 ``The debate is not going to be terribly pleasant,'' Kolbe said. ``I don't think anybody's mind is going to be changed by it.'' 

 Frank said Republican leaders resorted to the bundling tactic because they realized there wasn't sufficient support among House members for Hefley's anti-homosexual amendment if it stood alone. 

 ``The Hefley amendment became the damsel in distress,'' Frank said. ``They're trying to use the other one to rescue Hefley.'' 

 Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Rules Committee, said GOP leaders decided to combine the proposals because they both deal with what Republicans claim is Clinton's abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress. 

 But Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the gay advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, said ``the Republicans sensed defeat and then they backtracked.'' 

 ``Gay and lesbian issues are not a recipe for defeat'' for Republicans, Stachelberg said. ``I think those who support equality for gays and lesbians are more appealing to voters back home. Voters want their members to treat people fairly and not to discriminate.'' 

 Some Republicans agreed with those sentiments. 

 Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who isn't shy about taking potshots at the GOP leadership, said in an interview he has been ``offended'' by his party's efforts to push through the Hefley amendment. 

 ``This amendment is designed to placate our so-called base,'' Shays said, referring to conservative Christian groups opposed to homosexuality. ``I am being more and more offended by what people feel our base is. I am pretty determined to speak out against any statement that goes after gays and tries to dehumanize them for the purpose of gilding our base. That is wrong.'' 

 Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said the Hefley amendment ``comes off as mean-spirited,'' adding: ``I saw this as a potentially explosive issue.''
