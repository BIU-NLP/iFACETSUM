The leader of one of Texas's most conservative Christian groups criticized national Republican party officials on Thursday for inviting a homosexual congressman to speak at the GOP convention in Philadelphia next week. 

 A spokesman for Texas Gov. George Bush, who is expected to win the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his scheduled speech on free trade. 

 Cathie Adams, president of the Eagle Forum of Texas and a member of the national party's platform committee, said the decision to invite Kolbe directly contradicts the ``pro-family'' plank of the GOP platform, which does not uphold the rights of homosexuals. 

 Adams stopped short of pulling her support from Bush, saying ``I'm not making any threats like that right now.'' 

 But, she said, ``this is a quota. ... This is being done to pander to the homosexual agenda.'' 

 Kolbe is scheduled to address the convention about free trade issues for three minutes on Tuesday night. 

 According to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay conservative group, it will be the first time a homosexual man has spoken at the GOP's national convention. 

 Adams sent an e-mail to about 500 people on Thursday _ delegates and others _ from Philadelphia, where she is meeting with the platform committee in preparation for next week's convention. 

 ``My heart is crying,'' Adams wrote. ``I need your prayers for a response that proclaims God-fearing wisdom. ... 

 ``It's hypocritical to have that plank, then invite an open homosexual to address our convention just because he's homosexual,'' she wrote, referring to the pro-family plank in the GOP platform. 

 A Kolbe spokeswoman said she had not seen the letter and declined to comment. 

 A Bush spokesman said the Congressman's sexual orientation ``is not a factor.'' 

 ``We're pleased that he'll be talking about the importance of free trade and opening markets to American products and producers,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan. ``Congressman Kolbe is a leader in promoting and encouraging free and fair trade.'' 

 State party leaders agreed, saying Kolbe's sexual orientation is ``a nonissue.'' 

 ``I would respectfully disagree'' with Adams' characterization, said Texas state party spokesman Robert Black. ``It appears that Congressman Kolbe has decided that the broad issues that all Republicans agree upon is more important than his homoseuxal rights agenda, and that's why he has decided to speak at the convention.'' 

 Bush was criticized by Christian groups earlier this year after meeting with Log Cabin Republicans and saying he welcomed them in his campaign. 

 Adams suggested the party invite conservative Alan Keyes, who lost his bid for the nomination early in the primary season, to speak on moral issues ``to save face with all the families across America.'' 

 ``The epitome of that ability as an orator on moral and social issues is Alan Keyes,'' she said. 

 Keyes spokeswoman Connie Hair said his phone lines were down at his home and he could not be reached for comment.
