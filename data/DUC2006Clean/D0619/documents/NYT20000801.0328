PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep. Jim Kolbe's speech on international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he gave it at all. 

 The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz. is the House of Representatives' only openly gay Republican. His pre-prime-time talk on trade relations might have gone down as yet another unmemorable convention speech. 

 But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals. 

 Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov. George W. Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a Purpose.'' 

 Kolbe told the convention in prepared remarks that if elected president, Bush would expand trade. ``He will work to launch an ambitious new round of global trade talks, and he will enforce trade agreements and trade laws,'' Kolbe said. 

 Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe took the podium. However, Cathie Adams, a Texas delegate from Dallas, said that instead, she would bow her head during the speech to pray for gays to give up their ``unhealthy lifestyle.'' 

 And Tim Wildmon, vice president of the Mississippi-based American Family Association, commented that ``the things that these homosexual advocates push for are contrary to everything that 90 percent of Republicans stand for.'' 

 If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it. When the Bush campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee, you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,''' he said in a brief interview before the speech. ``The fact that it's a non-issue is positive.'' 

 The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he says about being a ``compassionate conservative.'' 

 Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of Kolbe's speech. ``We're pleased with the substance in the platform on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the Washington-based Family Research Council. 

 Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some messages better than it's doing.'' He noted that while a gay person _ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege. 

 Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event. ``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,'' said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican organization. 

 Asked whether there is a future for gays in the Republican Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is. The fact that I'm speaking tonight is evidence of that''
