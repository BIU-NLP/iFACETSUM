WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top campaign strategist defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on several issues. 

 The strategist, Karl Rove, said the group's leaders have asked for meetings with Bush ``with the stated purpose of coming in and explaining why Governor Bush is wrong on gay adoption or why he is wrong on broadening the Texas hate-crimes bill'' to protect gays against attacks based on their sexual orientation. 

 Rove, who is based in Austin, Texas, added in a meeting with reporters here that ``the national office of the Log Cabin Republicans has been critical of Bush and is in fact doing a fund-raiser for John McCain.'' 

 The governor has ``a limited amount of time, and we're just not going to set aside right now a time to meet with (Log Cabin leaders) and talk about their dialogue,'' Rove said. 

 Besides his hate-crimes and anti-gay-adoption positions, Bush, as governor, has refused to support gay marriages. 

 Rove held out the possibility of a future meeting between the group and Bush but said the candidate already enjoys support among gays. ``We have gay Republican supporters and advisers who are involved in the campaign and whom we meet with regularly,'' he said. 

 Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation's largest GOP homosexual group, called Rove's remarks ``very disappointing.'' He added that ``his comments are not at all reflective of the long and cordial relationship that we had with him for months.'' 

 Rich Tafel, the group's executive director, said Bush ``has created what has become a confrontational situation. We have now heard five different reasons why they won't meet with us. Now it's because we attack them. The campaign is saying, `We don't need to hear your opinions. Get on board.''' 

 The controversy began after Bush's response last month to a question on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Asked whether he would meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, Bush replied, ``Probably not.'' He contended that such a meeting would create ``a huge political scene,'' and added, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider. I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group of people against another. And all that does is create kind of a huge political, you know, nightmare for people.'' 

 Arizona Sen. John McCain, who also is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, recently met with the Log Cabin Republicans in Washington. Like Bush, McCain opposes gay marriage and adoption and new hate-crime laws, but he told the group he would battle discrimination against gays. 

 Meanwhile, in other campaign matters, Rove said Bush will accept federal matching funds for the general election, assuming he wins the Republican presidential nomination. Under government campaign spending rules, a candidate who accepts federal funds must abide by spending limits. 

 In explaining Bush's decision, Rove told reporters that ``it is awfully difficult to raise $60 million or thereabouts between the (political) convention and the Election Day and still campaign.'' He said Bush doesn't want to have to focus on fund-raising, but would rather be out ``shaking hands.'' 

 During the long pre-primary season, Bush has raised an estimated $70 million on his own, which has allowed him to forego federal funds and spending limits.
