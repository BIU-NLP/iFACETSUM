WASHINGTON _ In an intriguing campaign dance, John McCain has collected tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from members of a gay Republican group with whom he disagrees on a broad range of issues, from job-discrimination protection to benefits for same-sex couples. 

 The Log Cabin Republicans, whose spokesmen praised McCain's willingness ``to have a dialogue,'' have chosen to help him despite his disagreement with them on matters such as the decision Monday by the Vermont Supreme Court that homosexual couples are entitled to the same benefits as wedded couples. 

 McCain spokesman Dan Schnur told ``The Arizona Republic'' that the senator ``has indicated that he disagrees with the decision'' by the Vermont court. 

 McCain also backs the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military, putting him at odds with Steve May, a prominent Log Cabin Republican supporter in Phoenix who is threatened with an Army discharge because of his sexual orientation. 

 Yet on Dec. 14, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, simultaneously addressed members of the Log Cabin Republicans by satellite television at fund-raisers in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C., and raised about $40,000 for the campaign. 

 Phoenix was not included because many members there had already contributed to McCain. 

 The relationship between the senator and gay Republicans was noted earlier this month in the ``Washington Blade,'' a gay newspaper that labeled McCain an ``enigma.'' 

 ``While he has an avowed `visceral dislike' of discrimination, which presumably includes discrimination against gays, he has consistently chosen to vote anti-gay. His actions over the years have likewise sent mixed messages to gay voters,'' the newspaper said. 

 In 1996, McCain helped ensure the defeat of a bill, which lost on a 50-49 vote, that would have barred employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 

 Three years earlier, McCain was denounced by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force for agreeing to be keynote speaker at a fund-raiser for an Oregon group that sponsored a ballot initiative condemning homosexuality as ``perverse.'' His aides said at the time that McCain's appearance didn't constitute an endorsement of the group's views and that McCain considered tolerance a ``bedrock value.'' 

 The plan to hold the joint December fund-raisers was the brainchild of May, an openly gay Army reservist and state lawmaker who says he supports and admires McCain but disagrees with him on the policy permitting gays to serve in the military only as long as their sexual orientation is not disclosed. 

 Citing the policy, the Army is moving to discharge May, who has been open about his sexual orientation since he first ran for office in 1996. May was honorably discharged in 1995, recalled this year, and is now appealing to end what he calls the ``ludicrous'' policy that threatens his service even though he has earned stellar performance evaluations. 

 Last week, May's sister, unbeknownst to May, asked McCain about the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy during the question-and-answer portion of a speech the senator was giving at Harvard University. 

 McCain told Shannon May, a Harvard senior, that if there were problems with the policy, they should be looked into. But he repeated his support for the policy, saying, according to the Associated Press: ``Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, all the military leaders I admire, came up with it.'' 

 Steve May sounded disappointed in an interview immediately after he heard about McCain's response. 

 ``I guess McCain basically hid behind Generals Powell and Schwarzkopf, didn't really want to address the question,'' he said. ``I really admire his leadership. He's a man I want in the Oval Office. But I just hope that he is really willing to examine the immorality, impracticality and absurdity of this (policy).'' 

 McCain recently told moderator Tony Snow on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``I want to sit down with (May), and look at the specifics of his case.'' A meeting has been scheduled for Dec. 30 in Phoenix, according to May. 

 ``I hope McCain's not saying he's going to meet with me so he can deflect the issue. We never had a meeting scheduled until Tony Snow asked him if he was going to meet with me,'' May said. 

 McCain was campaigning in South Carolina and could not be interviewed, his campaign said. But Schnur, McCain's spokesman, said, ``The Steve May story broke over a weekend. Upon hearing about it, Senator McCain indicated that he wanted to meet with May to find out the particulars of the way the case was handled. Logistically, it wouldn't have been possible for him to arrange the meeting before Snow asked him about it.'' 

 Schnur said that although McCain might disagree with Log Cabin Republicans on some issues, they were in agreement on such things as ``lower taxes and a strong national defense.'' 

 In contrast to GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who has thus far declined the group's invitation, McCain sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates. 

 ``You're talking about those kind of values (McCain's) versus people like Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and others who have historically said that gays should not be in the Republican Party, that we are people who should not have civil rights, that we should be in programs because we're mentally ill,'' said Kevin Ivers, the Log Cabin group's spokesman. 

 Bush said on ``Meet the Press'' last month that he would ``probably not'' meet with the group, adding, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider. I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group against another.'' 

 Log Cabin members said they were confused by Bush's remarks, and some wondered whether he might be fearful of repercussions from the right. Southern lawmakers in particular were incensed at President Clinton's proposal early in his first term to lift the ban on gays in the military. When the plan was subjected to harsh congressional criticism, Clinton modified it into what became popularly known as ``Don't ask, don't tell.'' 

 South Carolina's February primary is central to McCain's campaign strategy, and he could be subject to attacks from religious conservatives if they believed he had gone too far in including gays under the Republican ``big tent.'' &QL;
