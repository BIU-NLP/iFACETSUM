AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush has vowed to bring minority groups into the GOP fold. But members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't sure whether Bush's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them. 

 During a recent debate, Bush said he would appoint people based on their qualifications, not their sexual orientation. But he has refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP group. Gay-rights advocates hold positions in the Bush campaign. But the governor promised a group of Christian conservatives that as president he wouldn't appoint people who espouse a homosexual lifestyle. 

 Bush's mixed signals reflect the complexities of cultivating a relationship with the gay community. If he embraces it, Bush could lose Christian conservative votes in the GOP primaries or, in the general election, against a socially conservative third-party candidate such as Pat Buchanan. But exit polls suggest that gay voters make up about 5 percent of the electorate _ about the same as Hispanics _ and they are concentrated in electoral-vote-rich states such as California, New York, Illinois and Florida. Conceding so many votes to the Democrats could be politically perilous. 

 ``There are lots of gay people who by tradition and heritage would be much more at home in the Republican Party, were it not for things like George Bush being embarrassed to be seen with homosexuals,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College in New York City who studies gay rights issues. 

 As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality, Bush's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well, Sherrill said. 

 ``This strikes me as a classic example of what happens when a candidate adopts a strategy that's designed to win the nomination, even at the cost of losing the election,'' he said. 

 In contrast, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley haven't been bashful about courting the gay vote, which could be especially critical in their fight for the Democratic nomination. People who identify themselves as gay make up between 8 percent and 9 percent of the Democratic electorate nationwide, and slightly more in the crucial primary states of New York and California. 

 In a recent debate, both Democrats argued that the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military isn't working and that gays should be allowed to serve openly. Gore and Bradley are cognizant of polls that show 70 percent of Americans support that view, although 76 percent of senior military officers oppose it. Furthermore, in the wake of several high-profile murders of gays, people are increasingly sensitive to the dangers of discrimination. Even the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher who founded the Moral Majority, has called for an end to anti-gay rhetoric. 

 During a recent GOP debate, several Republican candidates said gays should be banned from the military and characterized them as immoral. But Bush and his closest rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, declined to criticize homosexuality and said they support the current policy. 

 Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans. Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet with the group, Bush said he didn't believe in ``group thought'' or ``pitting one group of people against another.'' Many were puzzled by that explanation, given that Bush frequently meets with other political and interest groups. 

 Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because they politicize gay issues. 

 ``He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a group that wants to politicize it,'' McClellan said. He added that Bush didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he disagrees with its positions. 

 Nor would the Bush campaign say whether the governor agrees with the Texas GOP's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is that ``homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God.'' Instead, campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that Bush believes that ``it's not his place to judge other people.'' 

 Bush's Texas legislative record also is open to interpretation. Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas Legislature, describes Bush as ``pretty benign'' because whatever his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric. 

 ``He's not a Jesse Helms,'' Maxey (D-Austin) said in a reference to the conservative North Carolina senator. ``But at a time when there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the other is troubling to me.'' 

 When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and lesbians from adopting children in state custody, Bush said he believed that children were better off in homes with traditional couples. But the state already favors such arrangements, and Bush wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have removed children from gay and lesbian homes. The legislation never reached his desk. 

 Bush also declined to take a firm position last year on a hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected group. He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted that Texas already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't specify who is protected. 

 Bush promised to consider the latest version if lawmakers approved it, but he declined to help break the legislative deadlock that eventually killed the proposal. Gay rights groups suspected that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to support the bill, but Bush denied the charge. 

 Like presidential candidates from both parties, Bush opposes same-sex marriages. The Democrats want to guarantee legal and financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution reserved for a man and a woman. 

 ``Bush has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a good governor. But he does need to move more on some gay political issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the Log Cabin Republicans. 

 Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998 convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so. 

 Maxey suspects that some of Bush's positions are the result of political considerations rather than his personal views. He points to a conversation he had with Bush last spring on the floor of the Texas House. Maxey said the governor told him his stance on the gay adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Maxey, whom he ``valued as a person.'' Based on that talk, Maxey believes that Bush is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate. 

 Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's health insurance, not homosexuality. 

 Members of the Madison Project, a conservative political action committee, came away from a September meeting with Bush with a different impression than Maxey. Michael Farris, the chairman of the group, said he asked Bush about his comment that he wouldn't fire an aide he discovered to be gay. Farris was reassured by Bush's response. 

 ``He said I'm not going to appoint people who are open advocates of the homosexual lifestyle because their policies aren't likely to be my policies on issues,'' Farris said. Openly gay people serve on some of Bush's state steering committees, but Farris said he is not bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary. Furthermore, Farris believes that Bush has genuinely conservative views ``in his heart'' about homosexuality. 

 Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply doing what he must to win the GOP primaries. They say he may be more receptive to gays once he's the nominee. 

 Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans, said Bush should be well aware of the importance of creating a tolerant image for the GOP in the general election. Ivers argues that Buchanan's anti-gay remarks at the 1992 Republican convention tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President George Bush's re-election bid. 

 ``How the Republican Party deals with gays and lesbians is an indication of how it's going to deal with this persistent problem they have of being labeled as intolerant,'' Ivers said. ``The gay issue is the most hot-button issue of all the minority issues in this election.''
