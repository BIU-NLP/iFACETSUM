WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted Tuesday that the House will reject legislation that would nullify President Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation. 

 The House is scheduled to vote on the issue this week when Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., offers it as an amendment to a $28 billion appropriations bill funding different government agencies. 

 ``I think we will defeat Hefley,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only openly gay House Republican and a critic of the measure. ``But I never take these things for granted.'' 

 Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he ``wouldn't be surprised'' if the Hefley measure is defeated. 

 ``There's some very hard work being done'' to defeat the proposal, Linder said. 

 Kolbe said he expects the 20-minute debate on the Hefley amendment to stay focused on the topic of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Republican leaders, concerned that their party could be perceived as anti-gay, had hoped to focus the debate on presidential powers. To that end, the GOP House leadership had combined Hefley's proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local governments. 

 However, President Clinton last week rescinded the executive order dealing with federalism, thus blunting the Republican move to convert the gay-discrimination debate into a dry discourse on constitutional powers. 

 Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual and a leading congressional spokesman for gay rights, also predicted that the Hefley amendment ``is likely to lose.'' 

 ``We're talking about discrimination,'' Frank said. ``I think most people don't want to be associated with it.'' 

 Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who was among a group of Republicans counting votes on the Hefley amendment, also predicted it would fail. 

 ``It seems a number of members have looked at it and come to the conclusion that it was mean-spirited,'' Foley said. He opposes the amendment. 

 Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., said Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against gays ``is the kind of thing we need to see more of.'' 

 Clinton's May executive order added ``sexual orientation'' to a 1969 executive order by President Richard Nixon, which bars federal agencies from discriminating based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, disability or age. 

 ``It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,'' Bilbray said. ``When it comes to the workplace, we shouldn't tolerate any discrimination.'' 

 Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy group, said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the Hefley amendment will fail because of opposition among House Republicans. 

 Members of Congress ``are being confronted with this issue head-on without an escape hatch,'' Ivers said. ``This vote is unlike any vote we've seen in years. It is a complete confrontation between those who believe in discrimination and those who oppose discrimination against gays. There is no middle ground.'' 

 Last week, the House approved a measure aimed at San Francisco's ``domestic partners'' law. That ordinance requires private contractors who do business with the city to bestow the same benefits _ mainly health insurance coverage _ on the unmarried partners of their employees as they confer on the spouses of their married employees. 

 The San Francisco policy was enacted two years ago after intense lobbying by gay rights advocates. 

 By a 214-212 vote, the House approved a measure sponsored by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., that would bar San Francisco from spending federal money unless the city revokes the ordinance. 

 The Riggs amendment is expected to fail in the Senate.
