WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's first-ever meeting with gay Republicans may bolster his image as a ``compassionate conservative'' but the session this Thursday in Austin, Texas, has irked leaders of a nationwide gay GOP group who weren't invited. 

 Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said Monday the two-term governor looks forward to his invitation-only meeting with 13 gay Republicans, including rank-and-file members of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national organization of gay Republicans. Among those not invited were leaders of the Log Cabin organization, which endorsed Sen. John McGain, R-Ariz., in the GOP primary. 

 ``All Republicans are important in this election,'' Tucker said. ``We have to unify our party to be successful in November. Part of unifying is reaching out and being inclusive.'' 

 During his hard-fought presidential primary campaign when he was seeking the support of conservatives, Bush refused to meet with gay Republicans or representatives of the 11,000-member Log Cabin Republicans. 

 Bush explained at the time that such a meeting ``creates a huge political scene'' and that he ``didn't want to create a ruckus.'' 

 Bush announced plans last week to meet with the GOP gays at the governor's mansion, saying the post-primary season is ``a different time.'' 

 `It's important for me to unify our party. And I welcome the gay Americans who support me, some of whom are members of the Log Cabin Republican club,'' he added. 

 Gays and lesbians voters made up about 5 percent of the electorate nationwide in 1996, according to exit polls conducted by Voters News Service during voting that year. 

 But the gay community tends to support Democrats for federal office more often than Republicans. 

 For example, in California's March 7 primary _ in which voters could cast popular votes for candidates in either party _ 2 percent of voters in the GOP primary and 11 percent of voters in the Democratic primary told exit poll surveys they were gay. 

 Tucker said that Bush wants to discuss the ``common goal of ending the Clinton-Gore era'' as well as ``other issues of importance to the governor and the group.'' 

 Tucker added: ``The governor always likes to take the opportunity to talk about why he's running for president.'' 

 Tucker said Bush would discuss education, tax cuts, a defense buildup, and steps to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. She said she did not know if Bush would discuss proposals for broadening the federal campaign to combat AIDS or steps to tackle the discrimination that ranks as a top priority for many gay and lesbian activists. 

 GOP presidential nominees and the Log Cabin Republicans have a stormy history. Republican nominee Bob Dole, a former Senate majority leader from Kansas, rejected a campaign donation from Log Cabin Republicans in 1996 in a bid to cement political support from voters who might be offended. 

 Bush's meeting has stirred controversy within the gay community. 

 David Hanson, a leader of Log Cabin Republicans in California from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., wrote to Bush last week to complain that the exclusive meeting with gay Republicans in Austin was merely ``an effort to end the media story'' rather than an attempt to ``deal forthrightly'' with the issues that concern gay civil rights activists. 

 Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nationwide organization founded in 1978 that raises about $100,000 every two years to help Republican candidates in federal elections, said he has not been invited to meet with Bush. 

 Tafel's organization ran $20,000 in radio advertisements before the March 7 Super-Tuesday primaries that offered support for McCain, Bush's rival. 

 In a 1,800-word memo to members on the organization's website, Tafel said Bush's refusal to meet with the national leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans ``has illuminated many of the flaws in his campaign which may have an impact on our party's chances in November.'' 

 Tafel said that Bush ``demands loyalty'' before considering a meeting. 

 Tafel adds: ``Bush, far from being a uniter who is compassionate, has actually played upon divisions to win the nomination and now shows little desire to heal them. A candidate who cannot unite the Republican party won't win this elector.'' 

 Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to ``improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party.'' 

 Schmid added that Bush was holding the first meeting in history between openly gay Republicans and a presumptive GOP nominee. 

 ``That shows that Gov. Bush is trying to unite the party and broaden the level of support for his candidacy,'' Schmid said. 

 Schmid said that he hoped that leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans eventually ``will be invited to such a meeting in the future,'' adding that the first session with the presumptive GOP nominee was being reserved for ``gay Republicans who have worked with the campaign for the past year.'' 

 Among others who have been invited to take part are: 

 _ David Greer, chairman of the Pennsylvania Log Cabin Republicans; 

 _ Rebecca Maestri, a member of the Northern Virginia chapter of Log Cabin Republican Club; 

 _ David Catania, a city council member in Washington, D.C.; 

 _ Plattsburgh, N.Y., Mayor Jim Stewart; 

 _ Former Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis. 

 Log Cabin Republicans favor ``full equality'' for gays, including granting the legal protections of marriage to same-sex couples. Bush has voiced opposition to sanctioning gay marriages. He has been ambiguous about whether he would appoint openly gay people to posts in federal government. 

 Tucker said the Bush campaign is aware of Tafel's criticism but added: ``I really won't want to respond to him directly.'' 

 Tucker said the Bush campaign would await the outcome of Thursday's meeting to map its next overtures to gay Republicans and gay Americans for the fall campaign.
