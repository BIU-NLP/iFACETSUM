SAN FRANCISCO _ In the final days of his race for U.S. Senate in California, Republican Matt Fong's stance on gay rights has become a dominant concern. 

 The hubbub over Fong's recent contribution to an avowedly anti-homosexual organization is delighting incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer and her fellow Democrats, who see the issue distracting Fong and dividing Republicans before Tuesday's election. 

 The issue was kicked up again Tuesday as religious conservatives, led by a Sacramento lobbying group, attacked Fong, the state treasurer, for pledging to support what it called a ``homosexual agenda.'' 

 ``For a candidate to cave in to the gay activists in the final days of the campaign shows a complete lack of conviction,'' Michael Bowman, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, said in a statement. 

 The criticism came a day after Fong signed a pledge to support gay causes such as benefits for domestic partners and anti-discrimination laws, part of an effort by Fong to quell the anger of gay Republicans over his $50,000 contribution to the Traditional Values Coalition, which is led by the Rev. Lou Sheldon. 

 The national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, reaffirmed its support for Fong. But the San Francisco chapter of the organization withdrew its endorsement, citing Fong's link to Sheldon, an ardent gay-rights opponent who at one time suggested quarantining people with AIDS in ``cities of refuge.'' 

 The debate has pitted religious conservatives, who are active in Republican politics, against gay and socially moderate Republicans, who want the party to take a softer line on issues of concern to gays and lesbians. 

 And Fong, who has sought to find a centrist position, finds himself being attacked by both sides. 

 At a fund-raiser in the Chinatown section of San Francisco Tuesday night, Fong said he would be a ``unifier'' and bring the state together, but steered clear of any direct mention of the controversy over his donation. 

 ``We are a tremendous state made up of diversity,'' Fong told 300 supporters at the $200-per-person event. ``America is a great country because we've always chosen hope over fear. We've always chosen unity over division.'' 

 But Fong was less than eager to face questions related to his $50,000 contribution. He canceled a public event and avoided reporters at the Chinatown fund-raiser. 

 Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the candidate wasn't worried about losing votes, either from gay Republicans or conservatives. 

 ``Conservatives have been with us from the beginning and will continue to be with us,'' Schmidt said. ``No one has pulled their support.'' 

 Bowman, however, criticized Fong for agreeing to support domestic partnerships, or unions of unmarried people, which he said promote homosexuality. 

 ``Since the leading candidates both support the homosexual agenda to weaken families and society, conservative voters don't have much of a choice on Election Day,'' Bowman said. 

 Democratic Party officials have tried to capitalize on the division in the Fong camp. On Monday, Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland faxed to gay groups around the state the story of Fong's $50,000 contribution. On Tuesday, when Fong pledged his support for gay issues, Mulholland faxed the story to Christian radio stations. 

 ``He gets squeezed on this issue,'' Mulholland said. ``Here it is the last week, and this is what he's talking about.'' 

 Republican Party officials tried to downplay the issue, which they described as a fringe struggle between GOP groups that will never agree on a common agenda on gay issues. 

 ``I think voters believe there are more important issues,'' said Mike Madrid, political director for the Republican Party. ``The people who this concerns made up their minds years ago.''
