WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans strongly opposed to elements of the party's platform are running into roadblocks erected by social conservatives who on Tuesday vowed to defend language opposing same-sex marriages and homosexual service in the military. 

 Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition and the Family Research Council, both conservative bastions of opposition to gay rights, met Tuesday with Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the GOP committee that gathers in Philadelphia later this week to hash out they party's platform. 

 ``We felt good about overall tenor of meeting, and it did sound as if (the platform committee) would address some of our major concerns,'' said Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's vice president for public affairs. ``They don't want to sound harsh. We're trying to work with them to find a way to do that.'' 

 Gay Republicans ``want to neuter the platform so that next time they can come in and say homosexual marriage is OK and gays in the military are OK,'' said Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values Coalition. 

 A platform that does not oppose gay rights would be ``a defeat for pro-Christian, pro-family voters who are inclined to vote conservative Republican.'' 

 As is the case with other contentious social issues such as abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 

 On the one hand, Bush is intent on reaching out to voting blocs such as Hispanics that have not traditionally been courted by Republicans. On the other hand, reaching out to gays would cost him critical support from social conservatives. 

 In the short run, the social conservatives want to block efforts to eliminate the 1996 platform's stand against giving gays protection under civil rights laws. 

 The Log Cabin Republicans, an association of gay Republicans, and their supporters want to excise language favoring a ban on gays in the military, and supporting the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which permits states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. 

 The dispute goes into its final stages this Friday and Saturday when the GOP platform committee hashes out the final draft of the party's 2000 platform in Philadelphia. Republicans attending the convention then vote on the platform on Monday. 

 Win or lose, gay Republicans say they give the Bush campaign high marks for steering the party away from a confrontational tone. Hostility to gays, for instance, surfaced in the 1992 GOP convention when conservative candidate Patrick Buchanan called for a ``cultural war'' against advocates of gay rights and abortion rights. 

 ``There's no doubt in my mind there's effort by the Bush camp to send a message,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, noting that for the first time an openly gay member of Congress, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., will address the convention. ``We appreciate their efforts. We understand it's a hassle for them.'' 

 The 1996 GOP platform states: ``We reject the distortion of (civil rights) laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions.'' 

 It also says: ``We oppose Bill Clinton's assault on the culture and traditions of the Armed Forces, especially his attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. We affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.'' 

 In line with Bush's effort to reach out, Thompson met with the Log Cabin Republicans earlier this month. 

 Thompson's spokesman, Kevin Keane, did not hold out much hope for the gay Republican strategy. ``It all comes down to the 107 (platform committee) delegates who vote on what's in, and what's not in, the platform,'' he said. ``I suspect it'll be tough to change anything because the 107 delegates are from the more conservative end of spectrum.''
