SAN FRANCISCO _ Like an omen from the Book of Revelation, a wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over Colorado late last month. 

 The timing couldn't have been more appropriate. The cloud _ a harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology. 

 Researchers are increasingly convinced that carbon dioxide gas from the burning of fossil fuels is at least partly responsible for the marked warming of recent years. And the warming is accelerating. 

 ``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean chemist Peter G. Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey. ``In the next decade, we might see the same amount of warming that we saw over the last century.'' 

 In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest projections suggest that: 

 _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels could rise one to three feet around North America. Heavier rain and higher seas would increase coastal damage during storms. 

 _ The Pacific ecosystem, especially fish that benefit much of the West Coast economy, could be threatened. 

 ``There's lots of data showing there are big changes in marine ecosystems from the tropics to the poles,'' said biological oceanographer James P. Barry of the Monterey Bay Institute. For example, ``if you look at the record from 1992 to now, there's just been a precipitous decline in salmon stocks _ they're smaller and have less fat.'' &QL; 

 _ An ominous absence of icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping lanes off Newfoundland might be an early warning sign of global warming, Science magazine reported July 2. 

 _ New York City will suffer repeated flooding in the next century as global warming raises the sea level, soaking subways and turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, said a report issued jointly on June 29 by the Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia University. 

 Global warming might seem like an unreal issue to residents of Northern California: They are shivering through one of the chillier summers in long memory. 

 Still, such short-term coolings can't obscure the long-term signal that it is getting warmer all over the Earth. 

 New projections of global warming indicate it might be even slightly worse than originally foreseen. Previously, scientists expected an average planetary temperature rise of 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years. Now they're looking at a rise of 2.3 to 7.2 degrees, said Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. 

 That 1-degree difference in projections might seem slight, but it equals the increase in average global temperature over the last century, Wigley said. 

 One reason for the worsened climate projections is the increased success in controlling another pollutant: sulfur dioxide. While carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide cools it. Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming. 

 Now that hope is fading as nations establish tighter controls on sulfur dioxide emissions, Wigley said. 

 For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington. 

 In the next century, the rates of rise in temperature and sea level might occur up to seven times as fast as in the 20th century, the Pew study adds. 

 Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling. 

 In 1994, professor Gary Thomas of the University of Colorado at Boulder forecast that as the upper air cooled, beautiful noctilucent clouds _ common in polar latitudes _ would appear at southerly latitudes. The clouds are wispy and silvery-blue, composed of very small ice crystals. They resemble cirrus clouds, but are far higher, some 50 miles up. &QL; 

 On June 22, 50 miles in the sky over Boulder, a silver-bluish noctilucent cloud drifted overhead. It is the farthest south such a cloud has been recorded, Thomas said. 

 The southerly drift of noctilucent clouds may be the miner's canary of global warming, a signal of bad times ahead. 

 ``What we're seeing are some dramatic effects that are far greater than what the models are predicting'' he said. 

 Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control measures could hurt a vibrant economy. 

 ``We are astonished that some members of Congress continue to ignore warnings from the scientific community,'' said Walt Oechel, a biology professor and director of the Global Climate Change Research Group at San Diego State University. ``Climate scientists from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is real and could greatly disrupt society.''
