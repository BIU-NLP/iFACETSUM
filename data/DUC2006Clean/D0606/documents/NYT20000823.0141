As Earth grows warmer, the prognosis for human health is darkening. 

 Skeptics still dismiss the doomsday scenarios of the so-called greenhouse effect. But momentum is building for those scientists who contend that the time has come to investigate how global warming may hurt, not whether it's real. 

 Heat stress deaths in the United States may double by 2075, one researcher estimates. More Americans will wheeze from pollution, sneeze from pollen and grow ill from contaminated water, according to some projections. 

 Recent studies showed that abnormal rainfalls boosted mice populations and likely sparked the 1993 hantavirus outbreak near Albuquerque, N.M., suggesting that climate shifts pose infectious disease threats in the United States. 

 The forecast is worse for those living beyond U.S. borders, where diseases may hitchhike on bugs thriving in the heat and epidemics may wash ashore on ocean plants blooming in warm water. 

 ``It's happening right now,'' said Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard University's Medical School, who is among the most pessimistic of researchers. ``Glaciers are retreating, plants are migrating. We're seeing West Nile virus in New York, dengue and malaria in northern India.'' 

 The warming phenomenon is widely blamed on the atmospheric build-up of ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide, which are emitted during the burning of coal and other fossil fuels. The gases trap heat, upsetting climate systems, many experts maintain. 

 The consequences to health are viewed through the lens of probability. Rising temperatures, heavier rains and longer droughts would shake up ecological systems that influence human well-being. 

 Prolonged rains, for example, might cause new plant growth that would attract deer, which can carry ticks, which can carry Lyme disease. Drought may slow rivers, creating stagnant pools for mosquito breeding. 

 The possibilities are riveting to specialists across the sciences, from experts in plant migration to researchers who peek inside polar ice cores for clues about prehistoric climate. 

 At least two groups of scientists are tracking possible health threats. 

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, assembled by the United Nations, has concluded that ``significant loss of life'' is possible. Dengue, rift valley fever, cholera and other diseases may spread in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the IPCC reports. 

 The portion of the world population vulnerable to malaria may rise to 60 percent from 45 percent by 2100, according to the IPCC. 

 A group of U.S. scientists, meanwhile, is updating a report to Congress that will outline domestic threats from hotter air and oceans. The resulting climate shifts would drench some regions in more intense and frequent rain, while others areas would get baked by drought, these scientists say. 

 The group recently warned that warmer air will increase ground-level ozone pollution, aggravating asthma and other breathing problems, plus increase allergy woes in areas where plants flourish. 

 The report, the health segment of the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water. Floods may cause overflows at sewage treatment plants. 

 The specific impact will depend on a person's age and overall health, scientists said. 

 ``With heat waves, it's the elderly,'' said Jonathan Patz, director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Health Effects of Global Environmental Change and a lead author of the U.S. assessment. ``With air pollution, if ozone increases, it's people with respiratory problems.'' 

 Laurence Kalkstein, director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware, predicted that heat stress fatalities will double in the next 75 years if warming trends and other conditions persist. About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each year from heat stress, he said. 

 Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs. 

 But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too. 

 ``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said. ``You may get to the point where the heat just becomes intolerable.'' 

 All the projections come with caveats. 

 For instance, other factors may prove more important than global warming in the spread of disease. Expansions in worldwide travel and trade will be responsible for some epidemics. So will weak sanitation, water and medical systems. 

 ``A major problem is population growth,'' said Dr. Donald Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. ``Urban areas are growing at very rapid rates. People in tropical areas are living in crowded areas with poor sanitation. All these factors could allow an organism to grow, but they have nothing to do with global warming.'' 

 Forecasts also are clouded by the limits of science. Researchers cannot say, for example, exactly when and where disease will strike, or how severely. Nor is it known how vaccines, more air conditioning or other measures will insulate people from illnesses. 

 But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most scientists concur. Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4 degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down to depths of nearly 10,000 feet. 

 Palpable symptoms are emerging. Global icecaps are melting. Insects are migrating to higher elevations, and shrubs are taking root on the Alaskan tundra. 

 The scientific understanding of what role climate plays in health, meanwhile, is growing. In Uganda, torrential rains have been blamed for malaria deaths. A new study of more than 400 gastrointestinal disease outbreaks across the U.S. estimates that runoffs from heavy rains carried the bacteria one-third of the time. 

 ``It is indeed an emerging science,'' said Rita Colwell, director of the National Science Foundation. ``Will we have cholera in the U.S.? I doubt it. Will we have more severe events in Bangladesh? Possibly.'' 

 But most scientists say it's too early to confirm links between current human sickness and global warming. Predictions that reach beyond the proof of science risk the label of irresponsibility. 

 ``There are many, many reasons why malaria has gone higher in recent years,'' said Paul Reiter, a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specialist who has studied mosquitos at higher elevations. ``But none of them have been attributed to climate change. It's just make-believe.'' 

 Some scientists are guilty of oversimplification, said Hadi Dowlatabadi, director of the Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change at Carnegie Mellon University. 

 If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease, Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England and other chilly locales in previous generations? 

 Missing from current projections, he said, are adequate emphases on public health factors. Between 1995 and 1998, for instance, 50,000 people in northern Mexico fell sick by dengue fever, the mosquito-born disease that can cause fever, headaches and internal bleeding. Only 50 people in nearby Texas, meanwhile, were stricken, Dowlatabadi said. 

 ``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go the five miles over the Rio Grande?'' he asked. 

 Researchers on the U.S. Assessment team, while giving weight to such arguments, say they miss the larger point: With global climate shifting, risk is rising. 

 ``There's not complete agreement on all the particulars,'' said Harvard's Epstein. ``But there is a clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways.'' 

 (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) 

 Researchers scratching away at the question said they've found a helpful tool in a familiar weather phenomenon: El Nino. 

 El Nino events, the natural climate cycles that cause regional temperature extremes, rainfalls and droughts, may be useful dress rehearsals for more permanent shifts. 

 ``To the extent that El Nino can give you a short window into long-term events, it's a valid way to look at things,'' said Dr. Brian Hjelle, a New Mexico scientist. 

 Hjelle is among researchers who have examined recent outbreaks of hantavirus, the illness that has killed dozens in New Mexico and other Southwest states in recent years. 

 When people became sick with flu-like symptoms in 1993, the cause was a mystery. The afflicted got fevers, aches and chills. Next came headaches, nausea and lungs filling with fluid. Forty died. 

 Around-the-clock investigation blamed the white-bellied deer mouse, whose urine can carry the virus. Seven years later, scientists maintain a climate shift was at work. 

 The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak, according to a study authored by Hjelle, because El Nino-driven rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation, providing food and ground cover. When conditions turned drier the next year, the mice sought food in homes. 

 Scientists said they're now refining the technique of using ``climate signals'' to prepare for health problems. In East Africa, ocean temperatures and mountain greenery can be used to predict outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a disease that causes partial blindness in humans and forces pregnant livestock to abort fetuses. And in the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, satellite imagery has shown that higher water temperatures cause plankton blooms that carry cholera epidemics. 

 ``We really think we've made the linkage between climate variability, ecology and human health,'' said Patz, from Johns Hopkins. ``And this is where we need to go'' to understand risks.
