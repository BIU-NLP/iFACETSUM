CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists warn that a deteriorating marine ecosystem in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions foreshadows further natural disasters caused by global warming. 

 Scientists at Macquarie Island near the Antarctic note that elephant seals and penguins were starving off because of feed shortage caused by shifting ocean currents and climate changes in the region, today's Age newspaper reported. 

 Meteorological records show that the average annual ocean temperature near the island has increased to 5.4 degrees from 4.5 degrees in 1912. 

 Jeremy Smith, leader of Australian scientific teams on the island, said that the annual temperature on Macquarie Island was rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world. 

 "Macquarie Island is a barometer, it's a measuring device for large-scale global changes," he said. 

 "Global change is now a certainty," he said. 

 Higher ocean surface temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect of the global atmosphere will alter the direction of ocean currents. As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change as the marine ecosystem is disrupted. Elephant seals and penguins population are collapsing as their prey stocks are moving away from the Antarctic waters. 

 Scientists on Macquarie Island found that the number of elephant seals and rock hopper penguins has dropped by half in the past few years. Similar things have happened on Heard Island, 5,400 km west of Macquarie Island. Worst still, the rock hopper penguin population on Campbell Island near New Zealand has crashed by 94 percent. 

 Cindy Hull, a zoologist at the University of Tasmania in Australia, also found the unprecedented fact this week that 16 percent of eggs of rock hopper penguins on Macquarie Island were infertile. 

 She said that this was an indication that female penguins were not getting enough food during their foraging in the ocean. If food continued to disappear from the ocean, bigger penguins might also be affected, she said. 

 She said the decline in rock hoppers might be an indicator of the ecological impact of global warming. 

 Scientists on Macquarie Island fear that a one-degree change of global temperature would completely change one of the biggest ecosystem in the world. 

 In 1995, the sunniest December ever recorded on the island halted all major streams on it. 

 Scientists believe that the slightest hint of change at Macquarie is a clear signal that something significant is happening in the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean stretches like a belt around the globe. It is wedged between the Antarctic in the south, and the Australian, South American and African continents to the north. 

 "It saddens me to see, in a pristine environment like this, the deterioration of the natural ecosystem," Smith said.
