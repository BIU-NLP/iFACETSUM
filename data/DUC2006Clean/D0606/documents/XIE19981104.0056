WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker, Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

 Writing in the Washington Post Monday when the Fourth Session of the Conference of the Parties to U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change begins in Buenos Aires, the U.S. scientist said that global warming chould affect everything from energy use and transportation to water resource management and agriculture to international trade and development. 

 Baker said that over the past century, greenhouse gases have increased steadly: fossil fuel combustion now accounts for about 85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, agriculture, changing land-use patterns and deforestation are playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Since 1860, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent. Overall emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing at about 1 percent each year, he said. 

 On the risks of a warmer world, Baker said that a relatively small change in mean global temperature can lead to a large change in extreme events. This year's El Nino has increased rainfall, flooding and droughts. Increased duration and frequency of heat waves would heighten mortality rates, and the potential for transmitting serious infectious diseases would be increased, Baker said. 

 According to a scientific assessment, the globally averaged temperature will increase about 2 to 6 degrees by the year 2100. The related rise in sea level will be about 6 to 37 inches. With 50 percent of the U.S. population and 50 to 70 percent of the global population currently living in coastal areas, future sea level rises, alterations in storm patterns and higher storm surges could have devastating effects. Even with current global populations, a 20-inch rise in the sea level without adaptive measures would directly threaten 92 million people, wrote Director Baker.
