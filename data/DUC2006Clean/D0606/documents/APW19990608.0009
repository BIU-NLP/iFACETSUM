WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon. 

 ``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California. 

 The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon. It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, they said. 

 ``We don't fully realize what's happening ... but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries. 

 Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem.'' 

 While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the reasons remain in dispute. Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, including the El Nino phenomenon. 

 Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. 

 Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year. Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he said. And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said. 

 Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their energy and strength. ``We're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this,'' he said. 

 The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in the food chain. The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' they said. 

 Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat. While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, ``the early stages are already here,'' he argued. 

 As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change. 

 ``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry.
