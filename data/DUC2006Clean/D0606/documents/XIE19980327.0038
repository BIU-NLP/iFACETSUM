NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has undertaken various activities in Africa to address concerns of the continent in connection with climate variability and change, a UNEP official said Thursday. 

 At a press conference held here at the UNEP headquarters, Alex Alusa, program officer of UNEP atmosphere unit, said that UNEP had organized seminars to help African leaders in planning and preparing for droughts in Africa. 

 An ad hoc Working Group on the El Nino has been set up to review state of the science on El Nino and provide El Nino information to African countries as part of an Early Warning System, he added. 

 Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of countries. 

 He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system." 

 The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome distribution. 

 Many organisms in the deserts are already near their tolerance limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under hotter conditions, he warned. 

 Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture. 

 Although adaptation options theoretically are available, Alusa said, in practice the human, infrastructural and economic response capacity to effect timely response actions may well be beyond the economic means of some countries. 

 As farming depends entirely on the quality of the rainy season in most African countries, increased droughts could seriously impact the availability of food for the continent, he noted. 

 According to the UNEP official, a warmer environment could open up new areas for malaria and increase the incidence of yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis. 

 He warned that Africa was expected to be at risk primarily from increased incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced nutritional status. 

 UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer also addressed the press conference, saying that he was committed to making UNEP an integral voice for the environmental policy. 

 He disclosed that the Global Environment Facility (FEF) had given UNEP a total of 750 million U.S. Dollars to combat forest fires in Indonesia and Brazil.
