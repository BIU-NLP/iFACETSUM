MONTREAL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) today called for stronger actions to combat the threat of climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems. 

 "Climate change as a result of global warming represents a serious threat to the survival of biodiversity and the protection, management and rehabilitation of protected areas," the WWF reaffirmed. 

 Governments and international organizations "have to stop hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global warming represents," said Adam Markham, director of the WWF's Global Climate Change Campaign. 

 "How many ecosystems must be threatened before we listen to this wake-up call?" he asked at a news briefing at the ongoing World Conservation Congress in Montreal, Canada. 

 Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the burning of coal, oil and gas. Huge quantities of pollutants like carbon dioxide trap more and more heat in the atmosphere, ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance. 

 At the speed the climate is now changing, scientists predict the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000 years. 

 According to a study by some 2,500 scientists of the world, atmospheric concentrations of Co2 are now 30 percent above the pre-industrial level and a warming trend in global mean temperature can be detected since 1860. 

 "Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said. 

 Climate change is "getting worse," and it has already produced "severe" impacts on ecosystems, habitats, species, Markham noted. 

 In this fight against global warming, Markham emphasized that the industrialized countries should take on more responsibilities and keep their promises of Co2 emission reductions. 

 He singled out the United States, the world's biggest producer of green house gas emission, and Canada, the No. 1 country in per capita gas emission. The two countries produce more than 20 percent of all gas emission worldwide, he said. 

 If the present level of ecosystem is to be maintained, at least 20 percent of Co2 emission will have to be reduced worldwide, Markham added.
