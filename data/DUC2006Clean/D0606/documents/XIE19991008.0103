JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Environment Minister Valli Moosa said on Friday that global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria. 

 Addressing a meeting in Cape Town of ministers and officials from the countries of Southern African Development Community (SADC), he said that in the past year South Africa had recorded the highest average temperatures. 

 He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts. 

 "It is more and more a matter which is impacting on all people." 

 One of the results of this had been a rise in the incidence of malaria, he said, adding that "this is a matter which is of grave concern to us." 

 The SADC meeting aims to formulate regional policies on matters such as desertification, climate change and biodiversity. 

 Countries attending the meeting, hosted by South Africa, include Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
