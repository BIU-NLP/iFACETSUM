WASHINGTON _ On the west coast of Canada's Hudson Bay, fewer and fewer polar bears are being born each year. 

 In the Maldive Islands, coral are bleaching and then dying. 

 And in the North Pacific, sockeye salmon seem to be losing weight. 

 These are a few of the signs that scientists say point to an increasingly inescapable conclusion: global warming is threatening marine life worldwide. 

 In a report scheduled for release Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash-based Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World Wildlife Fund declare that ``global climate change is an additional stress on already stressed species, and may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many types of marine life.'' 

 The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming. 

 ``The news is not good,'' said Elliott Norse, the biologist who heads the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. ``The thing that screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with climate change.'' 

 Norse offered a variety of recent examples of the impacts of global warming, from the encroachment of subalpine firs into the alpine meadows on Mount Rainier, to the marlin caught off Longview, Wash., to the appearance of Pacific dolphins off the Aleutian islands. 

 Even the recent spate of emaciated gray whales beaching themselves along the West Coast may be attributable to global warming, he said. 

 In virtually every example, Norse said, species such as fish or bears or whales appear to be suffering from a lack of food that is connected to a warming of the ocean. Polar bears, for example, seem to be suffering from a decline in the amount of sea ice, which is a source of algae that form the lowest rung on the bears' food chain. ' 

 The report says the Alaskan salmon population declined drastically in 1997 and 1998, and that salmon that survive are unusually small, suggesting that they were starved. The report says that sockeye are particularly susceptible to temperature variations. 

 ``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says. 

 The report was greeted skeptically by critics of global warming science. 

 ``This doesn't surprise me, because they blame everything on global warming from tornadoes to droughts to heat waves,'' said John Carlisle, director of the environmental policy task force for The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank. ``But there is no firm evidence that man-made global warming is even occurring. The fact is that the Earth's temperature is naturally fluctuating.'' 

 Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning. 

 But Norse said the evidence that global warming is harming marine life is overwhelming. 

 ``Whether the warming we have been seeing is caused by people is unclear, but that is by far the most logical explanation for the fact that the weather is the warmest it's been for thousands of years,'' Norse said. ``The evidence is so strong, it's almost like the evidence for gravity. The people who deny it are denying it for reasons that are not scientific or substantive, but because it goes against their beliefs or economic interests.'' 

 Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Those gases trap heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are rising. 

 According to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees, the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have decreased. The 10 warmest years of this century have occurred within the past 15 years. 

 What to do about global warming is controversial, both in Congress and in the international policy arena. World diplomats meeting in Bonn have been bogged down in a dispute between the United States and Europe over how to address global warming. And the Clinton administration has yet to ask Congress to approve the Kyoto Protocol it signed in 1997, saying that it is waiting for more developing countries to sign onto the pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

 The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing potential restrictions in development in order to address other factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing, dams and hatcheries.
