WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Huge tracts of Earth's surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of" environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

 The panel, which was set up by the United Nations in 1988 to investigate the pace of climate change and advise governments on potential risks, is meeting in Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand, with 120 experts participating. 

 Houghton said at the panel Tuesday that one estimate suggests up to 150 million people may be made homeless as oceans swell with warmer temperature caused by the greenhouse effect. 

 A rise in sea levels of up to one meter could happen by next century, affecting areas of Egypt, southern China and Bangladesh, he said, adding that a rise of one meter would wipe out the homes of up to 6 million people in Bangladesh alone. 

 New Zealand Environment Minister Marian Hobbs gave an opening speech at the meeting, pledging that her country would honor its international greenhouse gas control targets and take steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming. 

 She said New Zealand will introduce public education programs on climate change, greater investment in public transport and stronger energy efficiency measures. 

 At the top of the agenda of the three-day conference, which will end Thursday, is its next report on climate change, due to be presented to the United Nations in 2001, according to the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA). 

 The report will contain an assessment of the pace of climate change and strategies for governments to deal with it. Two such reports were already submitted by the panel in 1990 and 1995. 

 NZPA reported that scientists estimate that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30 percent since pre-industrial times. If the present rate of emission continues,the amount of carbon dioxide will be double its pre-industrial level by the end of this century. 

 Evidence is mounting that emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation are affecting climate, it added. 

 There are 160 signatories to the U.N. Climate Convention, an agreement designed to stabilize greenhouse gases at levels that would avoid catastrophic climate change.
