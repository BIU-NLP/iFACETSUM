WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Global warming in the 21st century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says. 

 The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years. 

 Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. 

 Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought will vary widely from region to region, and some natural ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some may disappear entirely, says the report. 

 Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change significantly. 

 Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on computer models and historical data, and "American society would likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts." 

 The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out by nine federal agencies. The analysis was based largely on two computer simulations of future climate that often produce very different or even antithetical results.
