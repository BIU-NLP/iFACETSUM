BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Global warming weather will critically undermine efforts for sustainable development in Lebanon and other Mediterranean literal states, the Greenpeace Mediterranean has said in a report. 

 Daily Star today quoted a report issued by Greenpeace Mediterranean in Lebanon on Thursday entitled "Climate change and the Mediterranean region" as saying that climate change will add to existing problems of desertification, water scarcity, and food production in the region. 

 As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans expand. The level of much of the Mediterranean could rise by close to one meter by 2100, the report said. 

 According to the report, the worst affected areas will be the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level. 

 It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system. Reductions in water availability would hit southern Mediterranean countries the hardest. 

 In Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and Lebanon, water availability is already near the 1,000 cubic meters per person per year benchmark for water scarcity, and the report warns that live-stock production would suffer as rangeland deteriorates. 

 The 55-page report added that rising carbon dioxide (CO2) will also introduce new threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies. 

 As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and severity of drought could increase across the region. 

 Temperatures could rise by over four degrees centigrade by 2100 over many of the inland areas and by more than this over the Mediterranean Sea. 

 The report called on all Mediterranean states to immediately demand industrialized countries adopt legally-binding obligations at the Kyoto Climate Conference in Japan next month to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2005.
