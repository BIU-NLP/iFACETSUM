&UR; Close to Home &LR; 

 When Mae Shell was a child, her parents homesteaded in Washington State, building their own houses and living off the land, for a time without running water. So when it came time to educate Mae and her three younger sisters, the method they chose seemed to fit right in _ teaching them at home in the small town of Georgia, Vt. 

 ``We did it pretty informally,'' said Ms. Shell, now 21. ``It was very self-directed. We did horseback riding at a stable nearby. We went everywhere with my mom, to the grocery store, to run errands, to the theater. Math was kind of the only thing we really sat down at our desks to do.'' 

 Ms. Shell said she did not read until she was 8, which she realizes is considered late. She and her sisters also had little interaction with the local schools or the state system, and didn't take standardized tests. ``There wasn't really anything we wanted to do in school,'' she said, ``or that we thought the school had for us.'' 

 They received diplomas and transcripts from their parents, who lobbied unsuccessfully against a change in Vermont law requiring home-schooled students to submit a portfolio of work to the state or have their work reviewed by certified teachers. 

 ``We were concerned about how much control the state would have over how home schools worked,'' Ms. Shell said. ``True learning takes place when it is directed by the person who needs to be learning it. In the public schools it's sort of forced on the kids.'' 

 At 17, she took a few classes at a local community college. She enjoyed a short-fiction class, but found it difficult to be given an assignment to write. She preferred to be naturally inspired and did not like ``learning in such a formal way,'' she said. 

 She was much more excited about working in the public library in nearby St. Albans, where she began volunteering at 16. She considered going to college and trying to get a master's degree in library science, but ``No college in Vermont offers that,'' she said, ``and I didn't really feel like I wanted to go out of state at that point.'' 

 So while two of Ms. Shell's younger sisters went to college (one is at Smith College, the other at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst), Ms. Shell decided to live at home and get a paying job at the library, where she maintains the Web page, enters catalogued books into the computer and takes books to nursing homes and shut-ins. 

 Sue Wade, a librarian at St. Albans Free Library, said that compared with children educated conventionally, the Shell daughters were ``more mature in a lot of ways and less mature in some ways.'' 

 ``They have no problem talking with adults,'' she said. ``But sometimes they seem nave about certain things. They haven't had to be kids. They've just had to be people.'' They have had little experience with the kind of competition or teasing common among schoolchildren, she observed, because they spent their time among family members. ``They may not understand why people would even tease someone in a cruel way,'' she added. 

 She said home-schooled children, who are relatively common in the St. Albans community, seem to ``do things that are less likely to put themselves in situations where they have to be cutthroat, because they haven't had to be,'' Ms. Wade said. ``They have been often raised by people who are potters or farmers. One of the home-schoolers has a father who is a produce manager. That's about as competitive as it gets.'' 

 Last year, in Growing Without Schooling, a magazine about unschooling, Ms. Shell wrote of her only complaint: ``I feel very separated from my schooled peers because of seemingly insurmountable differences in our values. I have many friends, but they are all significantly younger or older than me. I often feel lonely, and long for friends my own age who are going through the same experiences as I am.'' 

 She has dated but finds it hard to meet many men her age. Still, she says that for now she is happy living with her parents: her father builds wooden boats, and her mother is a former potter who went back to college several years ago to get a master's in counseling. Ms. Shell helps out at home by doing the grocery shopping and chauffeuring her youngest sister to dance classes. She also writes poetry and designs Web pages. 

 ``I really like it here,'' she said. ``I don't feel the need to go anywhere else.''

 School just wasn't working out well for Emily Murphy. A bright child who started reading as a toddler, Ms. Murphy puzzled her teachers, who seemed uncertain where to place her. 

 ``They were shipping me off to gifted classes in the morning, putting me in higher grades,'' recalled Ms. Murphy, now 25. ``One teacher in first grade took an irrational hatred to me. I was really unhappy. The other kids would kind of pick on me because I was different.'' 

 Teachers were also so critical of her handwriting, saying it was illegible, that she hated to write. 

 After third grade, her parents decided to teach her at home, where she could proceed at her own pace. There was an added advantage: stability. Ms. Murphy's father worked for a railroad and had to move the family every couple of years, settling finally in Wellsboro, a small town in central Pennsylvania. Home schooling ``fit the transient life style,'' she said. 

 Ms. Murphy's parents worked to help her feel comfortable writing. She would dictate essays, and her father would write them down, until ``it got to the point where he couldn't write as fast as I would dictate,'' Ms. Murphy said, ``so I got frustrated and I would just write it myself. I doubt the school system would have had the patience.'' 

 On Sunday evenings, they held sessions to review what Ms. Murphy and her younger brother and sister, also home schooled, had accomplished and to set goals for the following week. 

 ``Some of them could be very tense,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``We did clash quite a bit when I was a kid _ `I don't want to do this'; `You have to do this.' '' 

 Her parents, now both English professors at Mansfield University, in Mansfield, Pa., decided that the children should take standardized tests and submit work to schools for approval. ``The way you beat the system is to learn how to do standardized tests really well,'' Ms. Murphy said. 

 She also took classes in dance, drama and art, enrolled in courses at a community college, and by 13, was working in a local library and in a historical society's rare-books collection. Her parents encouraged their children to talk to adults about their work, including the plumbers and electricians who came to the house. 

 ``My parents had the attitude that the world is not made up of 30 people your own age,'' she said. 

 Ms. Murphy always intended to go to college, and scored a combined score of 1330 on the SAT's. But one of the two schools she applied to, Penn State, ``basically sent me a rejection letter because I didn't fit into their system,'' she said. The other school, St. John's College, a small institution in Maryland, accepted her. She felt right at home with its ``great books'' curriculum. 

 She said colleges seemed to be more receptive to home-schoolers by the time her siblings applied. Both chose Williams College. 

 Now Ms. Murphy is an assistant registrar and curator of photographs at the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis. She squeezes a social life into her busy schedule but says she hasn't had time to date. Her answering machine's outgoing message features quotes from Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson. 

 Would she home school her own children? 

 ``My mom is a saint,'' she answered. ``I have no clue how she managed to handle three kids, all very bright, all rambunctious. I don't know that I would have the patience to do it.''
