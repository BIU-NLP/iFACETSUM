DENVER (AP) -- When Sherie Ferguson learned two teen-age gunmen opened fire at Columbine High, she jumped in her car and sped through traffic to find her daughter, a 15-year-old freshman at a neighboring high school. 

 The next day, with the death toll in the Littleton school massacre at 15, Ms. Ferguson decided she would teach Brandi at home. 

 ``Sending her back to Bear Creek, where security is virtually nonexistent, to me that's gambling,'' said Ms. Ferguson, a single parent. ``Look at all the copy cats. I don't think it's going to stop. How can it?'' 

 It is too early to know how many parents will opt for home schooling, but educators in Colorado said there was a 30 percent to 40 percent increase in interest immediately after Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, went on their rampage April 20. The two seniors killed 12 classmates and a teacher and injured 25 others at Columbine before committing suicide. 

 A month later, Thomas Solomon Jr., 15, was accused of wounding six students at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga., amplifying jitters about school safety. 

 ``There's a tension out there, and parents are very curious what they can do about it,'' said Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon. ``Many people see home schooling as a way to protect children.'' 

 Although the number of headline-seizing, multiple-victim attacks recently has gone up, government figures show a general decline in school crime. 

 In a report released last year, the Education Department found 90 percent of schools reported no serious violent crime in 1996-1997. Fewer students brought weapons to schools, based on surveys beginning in 1993 of students in grades 9-12. And the overall crime rate at schools dropped between 1993-1996, based on surveys of students 12-19. 

 ``My feeling is that it is not the safety issue as much as that that was the last straw,'' said Michael Kasson of the Colorado Home Educators Association. 

 For most parents, the decision to home school can take years and is based on numerous factors, including the quality of public school education, the specific needs of a child, a wish to emphasize moral or religious guidelines, or distance from the nearest school, particularly in rural areas. 

 Increasingly, however, parents are citing security as a reason for turning living rooms into classrooms. 

 ``It certainly was a stick in the fire,'' said Terry Deharsh, a locksmith who attended the Christian Home Educators of Colorado's recent statewide conference on home schooling. 

 Although there is an elementary school across the street from the Deharshes' home in Greeley, Deharsh and his wife, Lindee, plan to home school their 5-year-old daughter. 

 ``Thrill-seekers are going to look for a group,'' Deharsh said. ``If someone wants to kill my daughter at home, they have to know her, they have to have a reason to kill her and they have to come looking for her.'' 

 Even without Columbine, the number of home schoolers has increased 7 percent to 15 percent nationally in the past five years, with up to 1.6 million children home schooled in 1998, according to National Home Education Research Institute. 

 Suzy Parker, director of the Colorado Department of Education's home schooling program, said she received five calls a day, twice the normal amount, from parents seeking information in the month that followed the Columbine shooting. 

 In several states with fatal school-related shootings -- Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Edinboro, Pa.; and Springfield, Ore. -- there may have been an increase in interest in home schooling, but not necessarily in numbers. 

 ``What comes mostly is we get more opportunities to speak, to go talk to people about it,'' said Richard Karman, chairman of the board of the Oregon Christian Home Education Association Network. ``Those requests are up probably, a ball park figure, maybe as much as up a third.''
