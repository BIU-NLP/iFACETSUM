My daughter isn't ready for kindergarten yet. Which is good, because neither am I. 

 The biggest question _ public vs. private education _ quickly breaks into myriad other questions, all crucial and all confusing. As dissatisfaction with the state of American education grows, the alternatives also grow, creating a plethora of hard-to-evaluate choices. 

 Public education has deep roots in our society. A vast empire involving almost 50 million young people, 88,000 schools and trillions of dollars, public schools long have been the social balancing wheel of society, fostering diverse interests, dreams and goals. 

 Americans stood by public education through integration in the 1960s, the burgeoning magnet and alternative schools in the 1970s and the draconian financial cuts of the 1980s. But attitudes have shifted in the 1990s. 

 In a recent study titled ``Where Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School,'' Denis Doyle, educational analyst and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, reported that urban public-school teachers are more likely to send their children to private schools. In Jersey City, N.J., 50.3 percent choose private schools. In San Francisco, it's 36.7 percent, Cleveland is at 39.7 percent and Chicago at 36.3 percent. 

 ``And let's not forget home schooling,'' Doyle says. ``It's the fastest-growing trend in the country.'' 

 Brenda and Tommy Teepell of Baton Rouge, La., have home schooled their four sons, now ages 23, 22, 17 and 14. The boys were in a Christian school when the Teepells decided to make the change. 

 ``I wanted more of our family values to be part of our children's lives,'' she says. ``The boys participated in plenty of outside activities, such as sports and the 4-H Club. 

 ``Life simply turned into a big classroom,'' she adds. ``If we went shopping, the boys calculated prices. Traveling was a rich history lesson. The boys matured faster than their peers, and are extremely independent young men.'' 

 Approximately 1.2 million children are home schooled, according to the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore. 

 Catholic schools, because of their affordability and diversity, remain a leading private option for middle-class parents. And parochial schools score high academically. Between 1993 and 1996, parochial enrollment increased by almost 590,000, according to the Washington-based National Catholic Educational Association. 

 Private institutions are flourishing across the country. The Hudson Institute says there are 28,000 private schools nationwide, with 5.9 million children enrolled, and that private enrollment has risen faster than public for the past five years. 

 Clearly, private education is not everyone's favorite option. Many parents and educators insist that public education is the cornerstone of democracy. 

 ``Education is not just academics _ it's socialization, real America with all its glory and depravity,'' says Michael Castleman, a public-school advocate and an author who specializes in health. 

 ``It's a tremendous commitment,'' adds Castleman, whose two children survived a difficult search for a public school in San Francisco. 

 San Francisco has 15 alternative sites and 59 regular elementary schools. Castleman and his wife, Anne, along with several hundred hopeful families, opted for an alternative program. The couple investigated a dozen schools, keenly aware that their chance of obtaining a spot in one of the city's five most sought-after alternatives was slim. 

 San Francisco has open enrollment, a process that offers a modicum of choice: An application places the child's name in a lottery. Only a handful of families get into their schools of choice, but the lottery takes certain ZIP codes, a previously enrolled sibling and ethnic balance into account. 

 In their search, the Castlemans uncovered an alternative school that many of their peers had overlooked. 

 ``San Francisco Community Alternative School sits in the middle of San Francisco's working-class stew,'' Castleman says. ``It's ethnically and economically diverse. It's not everybody's first choice, due to location and no after-school care. We were delighted to receive our letter of acceptance without having to contend with the arduous appeal process.'' 

 Ginny Gjedsted and her husband, Al, did not fare well in the open-enrollment lottery. They also were reluctant to gamble on an appeal, so they enrolled their two daughters in an ecclesiastical girls' school. Within a year, however, they moved them to a private, secular, coed school. 

 ``The rhetoric and the reality of the prestigious girls' institution didn't match,'' Gjedsted says. 

 By the time the Gjedsteds' third child entered preschool, tuition for three hovered around $30,000. 

 ``It's a hefty chunk of our salaries, but I can't quibble with the education,'' she says. 

 Educator Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and author of ``Charter Schools: Creating Hope and Opportunity in American Education'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996), thinks public schools have failed to help many youngsters reach their potential. 

 Nathan, who also co-founded the charter-school movement, says the cards are stacked against children's being steered toward their highest potential. 

 ``Achievement and accountability are not emphasized,'' he says. ``Schools receive no extra federal or state monies for parent participation or high test scores _ many innovative educators feel stifled.'' 

 Nathan cites numerous examples throughout his book of teachers' successes which have been marginalized, their ideas ignored or challenged. 

 In 1991, Nathan helped spearhead the Minnesota charter-school movement, a reform in public education that has spread to 29 states. 

 Charters are public schools in which teachers, parents and community members work together to decide on educational programs and curricula. As public schools, receiving tax money, they are accountable to the state, as well as to the parents and the community, for academic results. But they operate independently of most district and state regulations, cutting through bureaucratic red tape that may hinder other public schools. 

 Not every parent feels the need for such innovations as charter schools, open enrollment or lotteries. Lloyd and Lori Thacker of Portland, Ore., sent their elder son, Jacob, to a suburban neighborhood school. They feel lucky. 

 ``It wasn't a perfect school, but Jacob received a solid education,'' says Lloyd Thacker, who himself is a counselor at a Jesuit-run private high school. 

 Yet Lori Thacker admits she wonders if 5-year-old Sam will get the same education as his brother. 

 ``I feel burdened by recent local tax attitudes,'' she says. ``People don't understand the relationship between the polls and public schools.'' 

 Last year, Portland followed a growing trend: Like one in four local districts nationwide, its voters rejected higher property taxes _ a boost for property owners, but a blow for schools, which are funded by federal money and local property taxes. Fiscal cuts often mean fewer enrichment programs and more leaky roofs. 

 The educational schism isn't likely to disappear anytime soon. More choice, not less, is the wave of the future. 

 These dichotomies have taught me to prioritize and become proactive in my search. I've learned to compare schools and family needs, to look into after-school programs, computers, art, libraries, physical education and more. I've become accustomed to asking questions, talking to principals and networking with other parents. 

 But even so, the process isn't simple. Even with the amount of data I've uncovered, I'm still not sure which route _ public or private _ my daughter will take when she starts school.
