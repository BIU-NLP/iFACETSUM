They are pioneers, in a way: the first wave of the modern home-schooling movement, the first generation of children to be taught primarily by their parents. 

 Some 15 years after states began legalizing home schooling in earnest, these early graduates are starting to make their way in the world. 

 Some have found the transition challenging, especially when trying to convince colleges and employers that home school is as good as high school, or when trying to get used to working in groups and socializing with peers. Others have had easy success, building on talents nurtured in their home incubators and drawing on a sense of competence fed by their teacher-parents' undivided support. 

 The experiences of these young adults have paved the way for the increasing numbers of children coming after them. Following years of court battles, home schooling is now legal in every state. While there are no exact figures, estimates suggest that the number of home-schooled children has jumped to anywhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million today, from 15,000 in 1970. Many, if not most, go to college, and schools like Harvard and Yale now have policies for evaluating their work. The Internet has vastly broadened the range of home curriculums. 

 Still, many mainstream educators remain wary _ about socialization skills and about the potential inability of parents to give their children the rigor and depth they need in all subjects. 

 There are two major trends in home schooling: one philosophy is rooted in religious objections to the secularization of schools and to teaching subjects like evolution; the other, the more free-form philosophy called unschooling, initially embraced by families who considered themselves part of the counterculture, encourages independent expression and exposure to a broad menu of experiences. 

 Increasingly, home schooling is appealing to more conventional families, too _ parents who worry that their children are not getting enough individual attention in school and are either excelling faster than their classmates or need more help in certain skills. 

 Today home schooling can involve strong links to local schools: consultations with teachers, playing on school sports teams, even attending a class or two. Many states now require standardized tests or portfolios of work for evaluation by state authorities or certified teachers, mainstream benchmarks that were up to parents to accept or reject in the earlier years of modern home schooling. Still, some families have almost no dealings with schools and view grading systems as inadequate or irrelevant to real learning. Other parents take care to immerse their children in extracurricular programs so they will meet children their own age. Still others encourage individual activities, including internships and volunteer work, which help make their children comfortable with adults, but not always at ease with their peers. 

 All of these decisions shape the way home-schoolers adjust to the larger world. 

 &UR; Big Achievements, High Expectations &LR; 

 Other kids always asked Tad Heuer why he wasn't in school and if he spent his days watching television. Sometimes in his hometown, Holliston, Mass., west of Boston, he'd get stopped by a police officer who would ``try to get me for truancy,'' he said. 

 But Heuer, now a 20-year-old senior at Brown University, loved being able to study American history and music without having to switch subjects every 50 minutes. He also loved going on a monthlong tour of Civil War battlefields and coal mines. ``I'm sure there were points when I was just miserable and said, `How could my parents do this to me?' '' he said, ``but I don't think there was ever a time that I wanted to be in school.'' 

 Like an increasing number of contemporary home-schoolers, Heuer had an education that was constantly intertwined with the conventional school system. His mother, a former elementary school teacher who thought she could do better than the schools, made sure he and his younger brother took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and enlisted certified teachers to review her sons' work. 

 Heuer took science classes at the high school, partly because, he said, ``it's not easy to buy one frog in formaldehyde'' for home study. In 11th grade, he took an English class. He had violin lessons at the school, played on the basketball team and worked on the school newspaper. These activities connected him with children his age and with what they were learning. 

 At the same time, he had to work hard to be accepted by the world of mainstream education. When he decided that he wanted the ``credential'' of a high school diploma, the Superintendent of Schools and the school committee were reluctant, suggesting he take a year of college first or seek a high school equivalency. 

 ``There was a lot of inherent mistrust of someone who's been home schooled _ `How do you know you did the same thing everybody else did?' '' Heuer said. He persisted: he deserved a diploma because of his strong links to the school and community, he said, and the officials gave in. 

 He had less trouble being embraced by the working world. At 15, he spent a summer working for a Democratic Massachusetts State Representative, Barbara Gardner, after she wrote him a letter praising an article on term limits he'd written for a local newspaper. Ms. Gardner said he seemed more well-rounded and mature than others his age. 

 At 16, he worked for the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Mark Roosevelt, a Democrat, impressing the staff so much that he was promoted from making copies to doing research on the opposition. 

 ``My guess would be home-schoolers would give you pause if they seemed to be a person of average talent,'' said Michael Gritton, Roosevelt's former communications director, now policy director for a nonpartisan think tank, the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth, where Heuer also worked after the Roosevelt campaign. ``You'd be thinking, `Who is this person? What have they done? What do they know?' You'd think to yourself, `Are they, like, coming out of a cult or something?' But he's so talented, you think, `Well, geez, maybe this home-schooling thing is something to consider.' '' 

 With a combined SAT score of 1290 (the national average is 1017), Heuer applied to nine colleges, improvising a 55-page application that detailed the work he had done and included exhibits _ a science paper on Canada geese, a tape of his viola playing. The transcript his parents created was 30 pages. 

 Heuer was rejected by Harvard and Yale but accepted by Johns Hopkins, American University, Catholic University and Brown, where he is pursuing a bachelor's degree in public policy and a master's in political science. Last spring he won a $30,000 Harry S. Truman Scholarship, one of 105 such awards given annually nationwide.

 Heuer felt comfortable at college immediately, introducing himself at orientation. ``No reason I was going to be any different than anyone else,'' he said. 

 His home-schooling background has made him interested in a career involving education policy, trying to ``transfer the schooling I got into the public schools,'' he said. But he's not sure he'll end up home schooling his own children. 

 ``If I could save the world and home school my kids at the same time,'' he said, ``no question I would home school my kids.'' But, he added, ``Am I going to please everyone who's expecting me to go off and do great things, be a high-powered lawyer or whatever? It's weighing the advantages that we've received from home schooling, and do we put that back into home schooling?'' 

 &UR; Now, a Drink or Two - and Evolution &LR; 

 When Julie Vickery's parents pulled her out of school in the sixth grade, she was in shock. 

 ``I thought that was something they did in the 1800s,'' she said. 

 Ms. Vickery grew up in Central, S.C., near Greenville, and had been one of the better students in her elementary school. She was convinced that she was going to be a failure because she wasn't going to regular classes. 

 Her parents, she explained, decided on home schooling primarily for religious reasons. 

 ``My parents were quite fundamentalist in their approach to life,'' said Ms. Vickery, now 23. ``They thought the public schools would brainwash the kids, not teach them how to read and write, but teach them all this horrible liberal thought. They were concerned about creationism versus evolutionism and the move away from the phonics approach to reading.'' 

 Religious home schooling tends to be structured more like a classroom setting, with the mother serving as teacher and using religious materials to supplement more standard academic lessons. Ms. Vickery's mother, a homemaker, tried that approach. 

 ``After two weeks,'' Ms. Vickery recalled, ``I said, `Mom, you don't know anything. Let me do it.' '' 

 With that, Ms. Vickery was allowed to choose her own textbooks _ ones that approached history, science and art from a biblical perspective _ and she became an indefatigable learner. 

 ``We had a core curriculum based on scriptural principles,'' said Norma Vickery, Julie's mother. ``At the same time that we were doing the academic study, we were also incorporating the biblical principles that went with them.'' 

 At first, Ms. Vickery's social world turned upside down. ``My three or four best friends all told me, `My mommy and daddy don't want me playing with you anymore,''' she said. ```They say your parents are really strict.''' 

 That hurt. But Ms. Vickery, who had also been teased at school because she was a brainy, nonathletic child, said she soon had an experience common to many home- schoolers: she began making friends outside her age group. She asked the Clemson University professors who lived in her neighborhood about geology or history. She played piano at a nursing home. 

 ``Instead of missing out on socialization,'' Mrs. Vickery said, ``we probably were more selective in the kind of socialization she was getting. Sometimes in the school situation, they can socialize with the wrong kind of people, people with entirely different values or no values, or just troublemakers and that sort of thing.'' 

 To broaden her experiences, her father took her on a ride with a truck driver, on a tour of an automobile factory and to see how a newspaper worked. Going to the grocery store became a lesson in math. 

 By the time Ms. Vickery was 14, she had ``finished every high school course that was recognized by the state of South Carolina,'' she said, and had taken the SAT's and scored a combined 1390. She spent the next two years researching and writing papers, mining the libraries of five nearby universities. 

 At 17, Ms. Vickery and her parents decided she would go to college. ``You're not going to gain acceptance in the world if you don't have the credential,'' she said. 

 She chose Northland Baptist Bible College, a small, religious school in Dunbar, Wis. ``I think if I had gone to a larger setting,'' Ms. Vickery said, ``I would have had more of a problem getting adjusted.'' 

 In general, she felt more comfortable socializing with the staff than the students. The hardest part was learning to ``work as part of a team,'' she said. ``That was very difficult for me.'' 

 In one course, for example, Ms. Vickery, who was majoring in education, had to collaborate with other education students to determine the best way to tutor a child. ``One person wanted to complete the textbook,'' she said. ``One person wanted something else; not all of those ideas could work. At the beginning I was hesitant to express my ideas to others. I thought, `I haven't been through the system; they have. I don't know how students are supposed to learn, I just know how I learned.' '' 

 Things improved as she became more comfortable. But she was still hesitant to talk about her home-schooling experience. Her faculty adviser did not find out until her sophomore year and, she said, ``He just about choked. He said, `You couldn't have been home schooled, you can read and write.' '' 

 After graduation, Ms. Vickery went to Korea to teach at a private language institute affiliated with a church. Told she would be teaching English-speaking high school and college students, she was disappointed to find that her students were Korean-speaking preschoolers. At the end of the year, she returned to this country and formed a group called Teachers for Christ International, a religiously based educational organization geared toward giving young teachers more control over their educational careers overseas. She plans to return to Korea but is spending this year getting a master's degree in education at Bob Jones University, a conservative Christian institution in Greenville, S.C., that emphasizes religion. 

 She believes that her home-schooling background can help her teach effectively because she can see classroom problems from an ``outsider's perspective.'' But now she wants to learn the insider's ropes, too. 

 Ms. Vickery said she is not as conservative as her parents. She allows herself to wear pants in public, for example. She also allows herself an occasional drink or two. And while she does not believe in evolution, she would teach the theory as part of a science class. 

 These days, she has a group of friends her age and goes on casual dates. 

 She does not unequivocally recommend home schooling. She has seen other home-schooled children who, at 10, cannot read and spend their days running around outside, saying they are looking for bugs for a science lesson. ``There are some kids who are so social, they thrive on team sports,'' she said. ``You lose that if home schooled.''
