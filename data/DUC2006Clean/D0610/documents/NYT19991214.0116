PURCELLVILLE, Va. _ The dormitories are still under construction in the hilly fields, but Patrick Henry College already has a few rules: Students will wear uniforms. They won't drink. They won't date, unless their parents ``are informed of the potential romance'' and approve. 

 All of which will set the college apart when it opens next fall. Yet what is drawing national attention to the school is not its strict code of conduct, but its future student body. Almost every undergraduate entering Patrick Henry College will have been home-schooled. 

 That makes them graduates of one of the most controversial movements in American education, one that gained steam in the 1980s amid a series of legal battles pitting parents against the government. Now that the first wave of the country's 1.5 million home-schooled children is reaching college age, there is a new debate: When, and how, should they be thrust into the ``real world''? 

 Critics of home-schooling have long argued children need exposure to the outside world and peers to grow into well-rounded adults. And home-schoolers freely admit their aim is to ``let children be children'' by sheltering them from the harsh realities and temptations of the modern world. But when do children stop being children? How do they make that transition? And what kind of adult lives will home-schooled children be prepared to lead? 

 Officials at Patrick Henry College, believed to be the first ever to target home-schoolers, think they have found an answer in their curriculum: The only major for incoming freshmen will be government. 

 In addition to their classes, students will write legislative papers for US congressmen, which they hope will then be used as actual guides for congressional staffers. Students will also participate in Capitol Hill ``apprenticeships,'' all to train them for a future in the most unsheltered of careers: politics. 

 ``If the real world means Capitol Hill, they'll be as prepared as anyone,'' said the school's founder, Michael P. Farris, who has home-schooled his 10 children, the oldest of whom is 24. ``If it is defined as the college bar scene? No, they're not going to be prepared for that a bit. It would be fair to say we're skipping one phase of wildness. We're skipping them straight into adulthood.'' 

 This intertwining of politics and home-schooled students is bound to draw notice, especially since the home-schooling movement is so often depicted as antigovernment. In the last 19 years advocates for home schooling have filed hundreds of lawsuits in more than 40 states, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association. The purpose of the litigation, in most cases, has been to get government out of citizens' educational lives. 

 But to Farris and his colleagues, the vision is entirely consistent. Patrick Henry College will be a breeding ground for the next generation of crusaders _ who may abstain from partying with the rest of the world, but will still work to change it. The school's promotional material states the goal: ``Eventually, these highly-qualified public servants will themselves begin to run for elective office and will have the opportunity to lead our nation back to its constitutional roots.'' 

 Those roots do not exclude religion, in Farris's view, and fundamentalist Christianity is clearly at the core of what the college hopes to stand for. Students will attend daily chapel. They must ``show evidence of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' the school pamphlet says, and must subscribe to a seven-point statement of faith that includes believing in the literal resurrection of Christ. Emblazoned on the blue-and-white folders being distributed to prospective students is a school motto: ``For Christ & For Liberty.''

 Farris's vision for student relationships is also closely tied to faith. He hopes to develop a ``practice of courtship,'' in which students ``engage in the activity of seriously looking for God's partner in life.'' Students who find themselves attracted to one another will be required to call their parents to discuss it. The role of parents, Farris said, is ``to help them make a wise choice of whether they will marry.'' 

 Campus life is still just a dream, of course. The main hall is little more than a steel frame in the middle of a muddy field, surrounded by cranes and construction material. The administrators, including Farris, work out of a cluster of townhouses in a subdivision of this tiny town in western Loudon County, whose other inhabitants include a Dunkin' Donuts and a McDonald's along a two-lane main road. 

 But, if all goes well, the state higher education council of Virginia will recommend Patrick Henry be approved to enroll students, a final step toward opening its doors in 2000. Farris said he hopes to send out applications as early as this week. And he is in the midst of fund-raising to help pay the school's $50 million in long-term costs; since June, he said he has raised close to $1.5 million. 

 Among those who have helped is the Republican Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who signed copies of a Patrick Henry biography at a party to raise funds, Farris said. There are other political connections, too: Janet Ashcroft, the wife of Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, is on the school's board of trustees. And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent, an influential Republican from Oklahoma, a ``good friend.'' 

 Those political ties will become increasingly important if the apprenticeship system is put into practice, as some of the 100 to 140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen. But there are those who wonder whether integrating home-schooled, and to some degree ``home-colleged'', students into the political culture of Capitol Hill will be as easy or productive as Farris makes it sound. 

 ``Their experience is of being cut off, to a large extent, from people with different values and different backgrounds,'' said Mark Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University. ``Once anyone goes into politics, to be successful it's necessary to know how to converse with different people and to know how to work effectively with them.'' 

 But to Brad Jacob, the school's provost, that is exactly why schools like Patrick Henry are in demand. ``We see this college as a transition from the home, and from a home school, into the real world of living on your own,'' he said. ``We don't think it's necessary to make that transition by dumping an 18-year-old cold turkey on a college campus. We're trying to make that transition in a controlled way.''
