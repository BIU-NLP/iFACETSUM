CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America. Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even more local: they are doing it themselves. 

 The number of Americans teaching their own children has more than tripled since the beginning of the decade. 

 Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise, since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois, collect no meaningful data on home schooling. 

 Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing by at least 15 percent a year. 

 Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower children soon had strange bedfellows. 

 In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and moral education. 

 Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who are dissatisfied with public schools. 

 The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction with the public schools was a more common answer than religious preference. 

 According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe, effective public schools for their children. 

 Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed. 

 All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation varies enormously. 

 In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly, and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated. 

 Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time basis if they ask for it. 

 In California, children can enroll in an independent study program through a public school and then do their studying at home. 

 Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their concerns are so well-intentioned. 

 In most states, schools are financed according to the number of pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). 

 The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The National Education Association handbook declares that ``home schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience.'' 

 Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force. Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong Republican backing. 

 They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics. The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level. 

 When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck down as unconstitutional. 

 Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every congressional office within a matter of hours. 

 At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted. When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent who approved. 

 When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to 36 percent. 

 Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject. 

 But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap grows. 

 The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of dullards. 

 Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific. They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the senior admissions officer. 

 Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name, since many of its most successful students have taken some courses in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not do justice to the idea, he says. 

 And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop socially without ever going to school? 

 Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.'' 

 Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of other six-year-olds than she did about her own family. 

 ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated herds.'' 

 Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted. 

 One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota, has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home. 

 Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are some real haters,'' says Nathan. 

 In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in the home-schooling shadows. 

 Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they are right. 

 A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is time to bring some about. &QL; &UR; ___________________ &LR;  &QC; &UR; (To publish this fascinating 1,200-word article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or fax her at 816-822-1444.) &LR;  &QL; &LR;  &QL; &UR; (EDITORS: Please note that this article is NOT available to clients in Canada EXCEPT to The Toronto Globe & Mail.) &LR;  &QL;
