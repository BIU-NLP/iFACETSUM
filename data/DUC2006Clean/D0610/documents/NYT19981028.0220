While the teacher settled his class down for a discussion of ``The Iliad,'' a 14-year-old student, Magnus Elhardt, chuckled at a classmate's wisecrack. The moment was typical of a high school literature class, except the teacher was 150 miles away, the classmate was 3,000 miles away, and Magnus, a home-schooled student in Thousand Oaks, Calif., was sitting in front of a computer in his family's kitchen. His mother, Maria, was ironing a shirt a few feet away. 

 The lesson, transmitted via computer speakers and computer screen, had the give-and-take of a classroom, complete with student banter and teacher scolding. But on this particular morning, the teacher, Fritz Hinrichs, was giving a lecture that was dogged by audio bugs _ stutters, reverberations and interruptions. 

 At times, the class was reminiscent of the Apollo 13 mission, with Houston frantically trying to reach an errant spacecraft. 

 The technology may be rough, but educational experiments like Hinrichs' are becoming increasingly common among home schoolers. Since the 1980s, home schooling has largely been viewed as an option for religious fundamentalists and ``Whole Earth Catalog'' types, but there may be a shift in the reasons people choose that approach. 

 In the 1990s, the number of home schoolers has tripled, and many participating families say they see home schooling as an alternative to mediocre public schools and expensive private schools. 

 Although it is difficult to categorize those participating in home schooling, Patricia Lines, a researcher at the federal Department of Education, said that in Florida, considered a bellwether state, a survey of home schoolers revealed a shift in recent years in the reasons for choosing home schooling: dissatisfaction with public and private schools was listed first most often, moving ahead of religious reasons. 

 ``It doesn't mean they're secular home schoolers, but their primary motivation has shifted,'' Lines said. 

 Home-schooled children now number one million, according to Lines, or 1.6 million, according to Dr. Brian Ray, a researcher at the National Home Education Research Institute, a home-schooling advocacy and research organization based in Oregon. (The estimates are based on different sources _ it is difficult to track the home-schooling population because reporting rules and mandatory school requirements vary by state.) 

 Technology is playing a role in the popularity of home schooling by providing a support system for novices and helping to blur the line between school-based and home-based education. 

 Home schoolers, as a group, own computers at a higher rate than other American families. As of 1996, as many as 86 percent of home schoolers had computers and almost as many were using them to teach their children, according to a study by Ray. 

 By contrast, computer ownership was less common among the general population of families with children. Twenty-four percent of single-mother households and 58 percent of married-couple households with children owned computers, according to 1997 figures from the United States Department of Commerce. 

 Computers can give home-schooling parents expert support for college-preparatory and elective courses for children of high school age, and a large number of children taught at home in the 1980s have now reached adolescence. 

 Home-schooling sites on the Web range from online academies to support groups for home-schooling parents. There are virtual trading posts where home schoolers barter for used books or supplies, and Web pages catering to special interest groups, like self-described pagan home schoolers and home schoolers in military families. 

 The emerging role of the Internet in home schooling has cracked open the door to more collaboration between home schoolers and schools and led to more interest in home-based learning. 

 In regions where home schooling is so popular that it threatens the financial health of public school districts, some school leaders have used computers to lure home schoolers partway back to the fold. In 1997, an Alaska school district seeking to raise funds to build a public boarding school developed a program that offered home schoolers the use of new computers (for a $200 refundable deposit), free curriculum supplies and support from an expert teacher if they would enroll in the district. 

 The families kept home schooling, but their enrollment allowed the district to qualify for more state aid. The program attracted 2,000 applicants, far exceeding district estimates, and the extra state money helped pay for the new school. Similar programs are in place in Washington State. 

 Some public school districts and charter schools are going a step further, offering their curriculums on line. Usually such services are free for home schoolers who pay local taxes; others must pay tuition. 

 One of the pioneering online districts, the Federal Way School District in Washington State, began offering its Internet Academy (169.204.208.10/Ia/newlook.htm) to home schoolers three years ago. In its second year, only 2 of the 250 families enrolled dropped out because of technical problems. 

 The academy's principal, Linda McInturff, attributes the program's success both to its strong technical assistance, both on line and by phone, and to the home schoolers' willingness to help one another. 

 nn 

 ``I have found them adopting each other,'' Ms. McInturff said. ``They are so excited about getting our curriculum that they're willing to go the extra mile.'' 

 Janie Levine Hellyer, a home schooler in Olympia, Wash., said on her four-year-old online support network, the Family Learning Exchange (www.flexonline.org): ``Home school parents, by design, are motivated, Home schoolers aren't afraid to ask questions.'' 

 There is disagreement among home-schooling leaders about whether the cyberwave is a major, positive trend or a minor, negative one. 

 Among those who see technology in home schooling in a rosy light are Mary Pride, publisher of Practical Homeschooling, a bimonthly magazine published in Fenton, Mo., and Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association, a lobbying group based in Purcellville, Va. 

 They characterize technology as a tool that makes it possible to offer advanced classes to the growing number of home schoolers of high school age and as a way to draw school-based students to home schooling. They predict extensive growth in the number of home schoolers using technology for direct instruction. 

 ``I believe what we're seeing today is not even the tip of the iceberg _ it's the glistening of the water underneath the iceberg,'' said Farris, who offers a yearlong constitutional law class on line. 

 Home-schooling traditionalists, both religious and secular, express concern about the trend toward high-tech schooling. The skeptics include Susannah Sheffer, editor of Growing Without Schooling, a 21-year-old bimonthly magazine, and Matt Hern, a writer and home-schooling advocate. They see technology as, at best, a minor tool that merely encourages the social networking that home schoolers have done all along and, at worst, as an unhealthy replacement for face-to-face community building. 

 ``The point is not to slip into some kind of Luddite freak-out but to realize that technology always replaces something,'' Hern said. ``As a culture, we have an inability to limit our access to technology and our use of tools like the TV and the car. To say that to be a good home learner you've got to have a $5,000 Pentium computer in the living room is confirming the elitist perception of home schoolers.'' &QL; 

 Technology enthusiasts like Mrs. Pride, the publisher, counter that the anti-computer home schoolers _ particularly those affiliated with the so-called unschooling movement, which rejects most packaged educational programs in favor of more free-form learning activities guided by children's interests _ are the elitists. 

 ``I think unschoolers sometimes exaggerate the benefits of doing everything yourself,'' she said. ``There is a reason I don't pump my own water and build my own well and make my own electricity and grind my own wheat. Yes, I could be doing these things, but if the objective is to have kids with characters and have a good education, there are many routes to reach it. I feel to limit yourself and say, I have to do it all myself, is a mistake. The outsiders _ they are used to delegating things to other people. It's this group we're discussing.'' 

 Mrs. Pride holds degrees in electrical engineering and computer systems engineering and was author of one of the first books providing extensive software reviews for home schoolers in the early 1990s, ``Pride's Guide to Educational Software'' (Crossway Books, $25). 

 Mrs. Pride has 10 computers in her home, three telephone lines connectible to the Internet, and five children enrolled in online courses. She has experienced the headaches and joys of using technology for home-based learning. ``My 11-year-old is always downloading some dumb game that I always have to delete,'' she said, but the computers have been an unqualified godsend for her 18-year-old son, Theodore. He was born with fibromuscular disproportion, a condition that led to uneven muscle development. 

 Four years ago, he suffered a life-threatening bout of pneumonia and endured a series of painful operations for scoliosis. Today he lives with three steel rods attached to his spine and one-third normal lung capacity. During his recuperation, his home-schooling curriculum increasingly focused on the computer, and he was a tester for several online learning academies. 

 He still requires breathing assistance at night, but he has nearly completed school and has started two Web-based businesses, one that creates Web sites and one that monitors and updates company Web sites, both of which he operates from two computers in his bedroom. 

 ``Learning at home without computers would be much more difficult and much less interesting,'' he said. 

 ``A hundred years ago, he would have died,'' Mrs. Pride said. ``Fifty years ago, he wouldn't have been able to finish his own education or have a job.'' Mrs. Pride is convinced that the home-schooling movement will grow because technology increases the comfort level of ``outsiders'' to the prospect of teaching their own children. 

 Even die-hard home schoolers like Maria Elhardt and her son Magnus can see the advantages to getting some help. Neither felt up to the task of tackling Homer on their own. The weekly online sessions with Hinrichs might have static, but they provide a solid structure for some challenging reading. 

 &QL; nn 

 ``I really like it because I do learn a lot and it gives me an opportunity to read these books,'' Magnus Elhardt said. ``I probably would not do it on my own because of the length.'' 

 His mother added that Hinrichs knew more than she did about Greek poetry and could do a much better job teaching the subject. 

 The demand for teaching expertise inspired Janet Hale, 40, a longtime schoolteacher, to quit her job and reinvent herself as a digital tutorial entrepreneur. The result is Willoway Cyberschool (www.willoway.com). 

 ``A lot of people who have never home-schooled before are hesitant to start because they feel they're going to be completely responsible for their child's education,'' Mrs. Hale said. ``Now there's teachers behind it all.'' 

 She now operates from a nerve center in her Reading, Pa., home, complete with eight computers and numerous tiny eyeball videocameras so she can conduct classes via videoconferencing. 

 For tuition of $2,250, she works with 40 home-schooled middle-schoolers around the country as their full-time online teacher. Her program is grounded in technology. Students create Web pages to hand in assignments and form groups to take part in teacher-guided Web searches for social studies and science lessons. 

 To appeal to a broader audience, Mrs. Hale is seeking formal accreditation for her program and planning to market it to schools seeking support for supplemental gifted programs. 

 Both Mrs. Hale and Hinrichs see technology as an opportunity for teachers to tailor their work to their own needs. ``The bane of teaching is paperwork _ teachers spend all their time doing paperwork for the administration,'' said Hinrichs, 30, who founded Escondido Tutorial Service (www.gbt.org) close to five years ago. 

 ``I get to read. I get to really play the role of a scholar and teacher.'' Today he and a partner in Idaho electronically teach a total of 300 students through a $10,000 computer system run out of Hinrichs' home, each earning a comfortable income of more than $55,000 a year. 

 They teach classes at assigned times all day long using cameras and microphones, and charge students a class-by-class subscription rate. 

 Easy access to proven expertise and guidance is a key appeal of other online academies, too. 

 Wendy Pierce, 42, a home schooler in Boston, was overwhelmed by the responsibilities of teaching her eldest daughter high-school-level mathematics several years ago. She had to compromise by reluctantly sending her teen-age daughter to junior college classes to complete her high-school education. 

 Today, she solves the same problem by linking her younger children to Scholars Online and Regina Coeli Academies, a pair of online educational programs offered by the Institute for Study of the Liberal Arts and Science, a nonprofit corporation. These academies link students to expert tutors in all the basic high-school subjects. 

 ``I would be lost trying to figure out the formulas and stuff,'' said Mrs. Pierce, who now works for the two online academies. The academies began in 1995 as a Compuserve discussion group for a few students by Linda Robinson, a schoolteacher in Louisiana at the time. 

 Today the academies attract 140 students in 33 states, Canada and South America. Classes include live chat, e-mailed assignments, tips on Web surfing and help for parents in organizing the curriculum. Junior-high-school classes cost $250 a year and high-school classes range from $300 to $350 a year. 

 The program technology is simple, like a ``schoolbus'' as Mrs. Pierce puts it: ``It gets you there.'' The teachers work from their home computers, monitoring chat sessions, fielding homework filed by e-mail and organizing bulletin board discussions. 

 As much as anything else related to technology, the online tutorial is a communication form in transition. Will the ultimate form lean toward canned lessons available through streaming video coupled with moment-to-moment recording of student performance on an online database, as Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, proposes? 

 Or will it lean toward live lessons with video, audio and various collaborative tools, as Hinrichs' model does? That may be one of those questions answerable only by time and technical innovation. 

 The potential benefits of live interaction were obvious while watching Magnus Elhardt study Homer. The students chattered in class just as students do everywhere, only this time, their jokes about the teacher's long-winded lecture and age were typed into the chat page for everyone, including the teacher, to see. 

 Several times, Hinrichs had to remind students not to just type out their answers but to do the online equivalent of raising their hands _ typing an exclamation point. There was something comforting and familiar about this interaction, and both Magnus and his mother enjoyed the interplay. 

 ``You can tell the smart aleck in the class,'' said his mother, peeking over his head at the computer screen.
