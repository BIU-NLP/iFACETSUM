 (NYT22) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CARTER-MUSIC-2, 10-28 -- Elliott Carter at his 90th birthday concert. There is a fastidiousness in Carter's ear for colors and the way he separates them one from another. The notes of a single horizontal line often fragment and pass from one instrument to the next; silences let in light. Perhaps this is why music so dense with diverse agendas can sound so clear. (G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo) 

 (NYT21) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CARTER-MUSIC-1, 10-28 -- William Purvis conducting the Speculum Musicae at Elliott Carter's 90th birthday concert.

 (NYT18) UNDATED -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- HOME IMPROVEMENT-B&W, 10-28 -- Many homeowners become complacent about home security because they think they have nothing worth stealing. What these homeowners fail to realize is that a majority of burglars have no way of knowing what is inside a home. Most break in hoping to get lucky. Given enough time, a burglar will try to make his own luck by tearing into a house. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times Illustration) *LITE

(Andrea Mohin/New York Times Photo) 

 (NYT16) UNDATED -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- MARTHASTEWART-PRETENDERS-2, 10-28 -- Pumpkin carving of Martha Stewart by Hugh McMahon. Armed with little more than a sheaf of recipes, a glue gun, some dried flowers and a puritanical zeal for modern homekeeping, Martha Stewart has built a $200 million multimedia empire. Thus, it comes as no surprise that pretenders are cropping up thicker than sprouts on a chia pet. (Abe Frajndlich/New York Times Photo) 

 (NYT15) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-NEWYORKER-CARTOONS, 10-28 -- Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor for The New Yorker, in his vast cartoon archive. He holds a laptop showing his Web site, Cartoon.com, which will soon add thousands of the magazine's cartoons. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

 (NYT13) NEW YORK -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-FASHION, 10-28 -- Betty Lo Mann and Steve Mann are connected by marriage as well as the matching cyborg suits designed by Mann. ``We understand each other more when we are connected,'' Ms. Mann says. ``It's the same way the left side of your brain is connected to the right side of your body, and so is the right side. There is no argument between the two sides.'' (Brian Willer/New York Times Photo)

 (NYT11) ST. LOUIS -- Oct. 28, 1998 -- CIR-HOME-SCHOOL-1, 10-28 -- Mary Pride, publisher of Practical Homeschooling, with some of her children, who are educated at home.
