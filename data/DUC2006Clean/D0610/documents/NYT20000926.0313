PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Education reformers of conservative or libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher initiative on the California ballot next month. It will be a major blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous state reject, for the second time in less than 10 years, the idea of giving public money to parents to help students escape public schools. 

 Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers unions, vehement opponents of vouchers, as the taproot of a problem that has far more diverse causes. 

 The California initiative, Proposition 38, would give parents $4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial, secular private, charter school, home schooling. It's the brainchild of high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper, a guy with more money than political skill. 

 Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched schools (which are virtually one and the same thing). He also did not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a similar California initiative in 1993, especially a lack of rules to guarantee equity and access in private education. 

 Draper has pledged to spend up to $20 million on the campaign. And with the issue tanking, he has offered Hawaiian vacations, computers and shopping sprees to folks who'll sign up supporters. But it seems a lost cause, Stanford political scientist _ and voucher supporter _ Terry Moe told a Hoover Institution seminar staffed by what the professor called ``a small band of nonconformists.'' 

 ``Who is supporting this? No one,'' Moe said. ``It's a bump along the road that didn't have to be there.'' 

 The most recent statewide survey of the Public Policy Institute of California showed more than a majority of likely voters already oppose Prop. 38 _ a near-fatal standing for a ballot initiative a month before an election. The PPIC analysis is that the measure ``faces an uphill battle in large part because it is not viewed as a solution to improving schools or student performance.'' 

 A similar fate may await a voucher initiative next month in Michigan, where even Republican Gov. John Engler opposes the proposal, which at heart is a repeal of the state's constitutional ban on public aid to private schools. The Michigan plan would provide just over $3,000 of state money per child in districts that graduate less than two-thirds of their students _ a formula that would include the giant (and egregiously problem-ridden) Detroit system and about 30 others statewide. 

 Among the initiative's biggest backers is the self-interested Roman Catholic Church, operator of the state's largest private school system. Model sermons are being drafted for pre-election exhortations. 

 The National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, is, as usual, playing tough. At its national convention in July, the NEA instituted a &QL; $5-a-member assessment to fight voucher programs, $3 of which (or some $6 million) is earmarked for the ``no'' campaigns in California and Michigan. 

 Only about 50,000 students are in voucher programs, meaning suggestions of success are anecdotal at best and provide far too sketchy findings on which to base wholesale changes in the nation's education system, even as troubled as it admittedly is. 

 Given vouchers' political baggage and the prospect of approaching bad luck at the polls, it seems that incremental advances with smaller, experimental programs, for vouchers as well as other proposals, would be a better way to go. But that suggestion from the Hoover audience drew what seemed to be an unappreciative sneer from some of the crusading ``nonconformists.'' 

 Chester Finn, a Vanderbilt professor and Manhattan Institute fellow who was a Reagan administration Education Department official, said that reaching for something bold and extreme sometimes allows the merely interesting to bubble up. That could be a desirable cause and effect, but there is little evidence that it's actually occurring.
