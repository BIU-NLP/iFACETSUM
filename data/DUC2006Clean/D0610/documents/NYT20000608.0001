KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 13, Michael Brown pulled apart 60 computers that had been left for trash. As part of his home-schooling, he turned them into 35 working machines. 

 Five years later, those computers are being used by his four brothers, a sister and home-schoolers in their Blue Springs, Mo., community. 

 There is sweet symmetry to this: The proliferation of computers is partly responsible for a boom in home schooling, a movement that's attracting more gifted children. 

 Access to the Internet has made home curriculums richer than ever before. And they've also provided the parent/teachers the information they need to enter their students in local, state and national competitions. 

 .MDNM/And those students are winning. 

 Just last week, homeschooler George A. Thampy of Missouri placed first at the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Washington. Two other home-schooled students placed second and third. 

 The previous week, George placed second in the National Geography Bee. 

 The 12-year-old from suburban St. Louis was the second homeschooler to win the spelling bee. In 1997 Rebecca Sealfon of Brooklyn, N.Y., won. 

 ``As homeschoolers learn they are eligible to compete in these competitions, they begin joining in droves,'' said Michael Farris, executive director of the Center for Home School Education Legal Department. 

 ``We started a national homeschoolers' debate program four years ago with about 150 kids. Now there are 1,200 members.'' 

 Twenty-seven of the 248 national spelling bee contestants this year were schooled at home. 

 But computers alone don't explain why more home-schooled children are appearing in major academic competitions. 

 Within the last five years, some educators say, major corporations that sponsor these contests have begun to accept home schooling as a legitimate, alternative form of education. 

 ``Years ago when we applied to get into district contests, we were turned away,'' said Barbie Lay, president of Johnson County (Kan.) Parent Educators, which has more than 900 families as members. 

 ``But doors continued to open as more numbers of us started knocking on them saying, `Can we get our children involved?' '' 

 No firm statistics exist on the prevalence of home education, but experts say it's becoming more popular. According to the Center for Home School Education in Virginia, as many as 1.7 million children in the United States are taught at home. About 30,000 to 35,000 live in Missouri, and 15,000 to 17,500 in Kansas. 

 In the early days of the movement, most parents home schooled for religious reasons, and not all of the students did so well, said Peter Rosenstein, executive director of the National Association for Gifted Children. 

 ``But now a lot of gifted kids become home schooled because their school can't meet their needs,'' he said. 

 Brown is a stellar example. When he was 11 and ready for sixth grade, his mother said, she wanted him in the Blue Springs School District's gifted program. She says she was told that he hadn't lived in the district long enough to be properly tested and therefore wasn't yet eligible. The Browns had moved from California two years earlier. 

 ``We decided his needs were not being met and he would be educated at home,'' said Brown's mother, Robin Brown. ``He was our experimental child.'' 

 By 16, Brown was enrolled at Longview Community College. While his peers in the class of 2000 were collecting high school diplomas, he was getting his associate's degree. 

 Brown starts a pre-med program at the University of Missouri-Columbia in the fall. He wants to be a doctor or medical researcher. 

 ``I think being home schooled made the difference,'' said Brown, who is 18. ``If I had stayed in public school I wouldn't be where I am now.'' 

 Brown was not a contest joiner, but his 13-year-old brother, Grant, wants to be. He's constructing a Web page he will enter in a local technology competition this summer. He learned about the contest from other homeschoolers he chats with via computer. 

 Public schools still have the advantage in areas like science and sports. But as even more resources become available, advocates of the movement predict that homeschoolers will be more competitive in those arenas, too. 

 ``Home-schooled children are just like public school children _ they are all different and they learn differently,'' said Robin Brown, who is teaching Grant and his sister Nicole, 11, at home, while their brothers, Nathan, 10, Ephraim, 7, and Caleb, 6, attend Young Elementary School. 

 Robin and her husband, David Brown, dispute those who say only the gifted home schoolers are successful. 

 But Cathy Zeysing, owner of Cathy's Creative Dance School in Independence, has noticed that the homeschoolers in her studio who excel are also otherwise exceptional. 

 Zeysing is a parent, and she teaches remedial reading in Blue Springs schools. Like others involved in mainstream education, she wonders whether the home schooler can be well-rounded. 

 ``I am a teacher and I don't think I have all the skills to teach my child everything my child would need to be successful in life,'' Zeysing said. 

 ``My hats go off to parents who do this.'' 

 The Browns say it's not easy, but the key is remembering this: ``Gifted is a relative term.'' 

 Their daughter Nicole doesn't like to read. She prefers crafts and animals but has read many of the same books Grant has read. 

 ``She is also pretty good at the hula,'' her dad said. 

 But unlike Grant, their mother said, Nicole probably will not go to college. She wants to go to cosmetology school. 

 ``I tell her fine, just do your best. Nicole will probably be a gifted hairdresser.''
