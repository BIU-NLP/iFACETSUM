America must never give up on public education. The surest predictor of any nation's future is the priority it gives to educating its young. Nations, like families, express their priorities in the things for which they're willing to spend their money. Excellence in education can be expensive, Lloyd Bentsen once remarked, ``but not half as expensive as ignorance.'' 

 One of the policy disagreements that kept Congress and the president at loggerheads for months this year was whether to budget $1.1 billion to help states hire 100,000 more classroom teachers and thus reduce the widespread overcrowding that handicaps learning. 

 The item was finally accepted. But other goals, like computerizing every classroom, making sure every child reads by the third grade, and making two years of junior college as standard as a high school diploma went unfunded. Legislators who assent without murmur to annual military budgets approaching $300 billion and multibillion-dollar highway bills seem pickier when it comes to the public schools. 

 Some hark back to pre-World War II days, when federal monies played practically no part in educating America's children. States and school districts had virtually the entire responsibility. Glaring disparities were widespread. Massachusetts, for example, apportioned eight times as much for each of its students annually as did Mississippi. For low- to medium-income families throughout America, the quality of educational opportunity became an accident of geography. 

 Then modern war taught us that the general level of learning was as essential to our national survival as the quality of our arms. By President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, it became a matter of national pride to ensure the humblest American child a birthright to a first-class education. 

 Virtually every American profited in some way from the GI Bill of Rights that sprang from World War II. It may have been history's most massive transfusion of money into education. That program paid rich dividends to the nation. The percent of America's youth finishing four years of college increased in one generation from 4.5 percent to 21.5 percent. America boomed economically and bloomed intellectually. 

 As a financial investment, the GI Bill paid for itself at least 40 times over. Because college graduates earn more, they've paid more taxes. As a direct result of America's enhanced earning power, the coffers of the U.S. Treasury have been enriched enormously. And every one of us is a beneficiary of the discoveries, inventions and technologies flowing from the fountains of knowledge that bold experiment unleashed. 

 When the Soviets beat us into space in 1957 with Sputnik, it shocked us into the sudden realization that we'd neglected scientific studies. Uncomfortably apprehensive at being behind, we launched our massive space effort, which ultimately overtook and surpassed that of the Soviets. With a sense of national survival at stake, Democratic and Republican members of Congress submerged their differences and joined hands, not quarreling over credit. 

 The global economy now bursting upon the scene must convince us that our quality of life depends more than ever upon a high level of education, broadly shared. A handful of geniuses won't suffice. The widespread diffusion of knowledge and modern job skills among ordinary Americans will be our surest salvation. 

 Some haven't yet comprehended the truth that it matters to all of us how the rest of us are educated. Here in Texas, some residents of affluent neighborhoods appear to resent the state law that shares a part of their property taxes with our state's impoverished school districts. A few school boards have sought ways to circumvent that law. 

 Meanwhile, some critics are almost ready to give up on the public schools. Conscientious parents, eager to have the best for their children, increasingly resort to home schooling. Both national and state legislators, looking for an easy fix, want to abdicate the responsibility of providing excellence in public education. They'd prefer to offer vouchers, subsidizing private schools while further draining public school systems, relegating them to second-rate status. 

 There's a lot to admire in parents who are willing to oversee their children's education personally on a daily basis. Parental guidance is vital. It takes patience and perseverance to teach one's own child, at home, all those things that an enlightened educational curriculum requires. My hat is off to those who try. 

 For most Americans, however, daily home schooling would present insurmountable problems. The vast majority of parents today couldn't manage that. The average American family now has two bread-earners, not one. What comforts will they sacrifice so that one can be at home all day, every day, teaching the children all the good things they'd otherwise learn in school? 

 Moreover, I believe that a vital part of the learning comes from the mixing. A broad education cannot be administered in a vacuum. For most children, the elementary grades have been our most important introduction to the wide world of other people. And in this increasingly global environment, nobody and no nation can survive indefinitely within a protective shell. 

 That's why I do not rue the property taxes we pay on our residence to the Crowley school district, or resent any portion that may end up helping children in El Paso or the Rio Grande Valley. It could tap some wellspring of undiscovered genius from whose works mankind will benefit. What better use of money could there be?
