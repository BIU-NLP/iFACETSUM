WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing home school movement commanded an audience Friday with five of the nine Republicans running for president, each proclaiming that if parents want to teach their children at home, the government should let them. 

 ``We view home schooling as something to be respected and something to be protected,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a conference of the Home School Legal Defense Association. 

 ``Respected for the energy and commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers. Protected -- protected -- from the interference of government.'' 

 The candidates, who appeared separately in the Daughters of the American Revolution auditorium, were unanimous in their salute of the movement's progress. An association-sponsored study last spring showed that home-schooled students, numbering an estimated 1.5 million, score well above the national median on standardized tests and often study above their normal grade level. 

 ``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a lousy school. Period,'' said publisher Steve Forbes. 

 ``You've shamed the regular school systems with what you've achieved. For those who have carped and criticized and said, 'What about socialization?' ... you look at some of our schools, you call that socialization?'' 

 Gary Bauer, an undersecretary in President's Reagan's Education Department, promised, ``When I'm in the White House, you will have a reliable friend for home schooling sitting in the Oval Office.'' Home-schooling parents are ``on the front lines, the cutting edge of the education debate,'' Bauer said. 

 The speaker's roster of presidential candidates, including Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, plus independent New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, was testimony to the potency of education in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public schools. 

 Since the association was founded in 1983, when home schooling was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today, the number of children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from a couple hundred to today's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million, said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson. 

 During a musical slide show between political speakers and prayer offerings, the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the screen flashed Patrick Henry's immortal line, ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' 

 Michael Farris, president of the Virginia-based association, said his 65,000-member families -- up from 29,000 in 1993 -- have just one message to Washington policymakers: ``Leave us alone.'' 

 Bush offered just a couple sentences on home schooling before launching into his standard stump speech. ``I know this might not be the proper forum for a political speech,'' Bush said. ``But I can't resist.'' 

 He encouraged activism by his religious audience. ``The role of the president is to say to people of faith, 'You're welcome to help change America because changing hearts will change America for the better,''' Bush said. 

 Jan Childress, visiting from Kalona, Iowa, with her home-schooled son, sported a Keyes campaign button. But, after hearing Bush, she told a reporter: ``Maybe it won't be so bad if he is elected. I'm beginning to feel like I can more trust what he's saying.''
