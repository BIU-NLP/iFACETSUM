BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A home-schooling mother was released from jail Tuesday after spending nearly two weeks behind bars in a dispute with public school officials over her son's special education needs. 

 In a case closely watched by advocates of school choice, Karen Maple was set free by the judge who had jailed her on contempt charges on Sept. 1. She had refused to follow an order to take her 15-year-old son, Trevor, to Vermont's child protection agency so his education needs could be evaluated. 

 In setting Ms. Maple free, Judge Michael Kupersmith threatened to fine her $100 a day if she doesn't take Trevor to the agency on Friday. 

 Ms. Maple said she didn't know where her son was, although she believed he was staying with friends. 

 ``I don't want my son locked up and treated the way I've been treated for the last two weeks,'' the 36-year-old single mother said, weeping, after the hearing. ``He's now considered a fugitive and he's just a child.'' 

 William Young, the commissioner of the child welfare agency, said officials had no intentions of locking up Trevor. ``Many of the children in our custody are at home,'' he said. 

 The case has drawn wide attention and sympathy for Ms. Maple. About 30 people demonstrated in her support outside the courthouse Tuesday and then lined the spectators' gallery during her hearing. 

 An editorial last Friday in The Wall Street Journal said cases like Ms. Maple's extend ``beyond the issue of home schooling to the fundamental rights of families to raise their children the way they see fit.'' 

 Vermont parents are allowed to school their children at home but must submit an annual report to the state Department of Education describing the academic program. 

 But Ms. Maple and her local school district in Bakersfield were unable to agree on an education plan for Trevor, and administrators decided Trevor needed special education services because he was behind on reading and other language skills. 

 Ms. Maple says her son loves science, is a whiz at math and that they're working on his language skills. She said she's agreed to have a tutor brought in to help Trevor with language skills. 

 Ms. Maple has said she resented school officials' intrusion into her family's life. 

 Kupersmith granted Ms. Maple's release Tuesday on a motion by the state Department of Corrections, which argued that the state needs its scarce jail beds for violent offenders. 

 ``This case is supposed to be about the best interests of the child,'' the judge said. ``While Ms. Maple is incarcerated, all of T.M.'s (Trevor Maple's) interests are being ignored.'' 

 Kupersmith also acknowledged that continuing Maple's incarceration ``is not likely to ensure the appearance of her son.''
