BOSTON _ When naming their three black boys, Michelle and Alan Shaw chose words that would underscore treasured roots and religion: Chinua, Nigerian for God's own blessing; Yesuto, Ghanaian for belongs to Jesus; and Obasi, Nigerian for in honor of God. 

 So, when it came to selecting the best school for their boys, the Dorchester couple _ she an attorney with a Harvard law degree, he a computer expert with a master's and doctorate from MIT _ took the same care. 

 Home, they decided, was the best place to teach their children strong academics, religious values, and instill their own sense of ethnic pride. 

 ``For black people in this country, there is a need for not letting our kids forget their history,'' saidAlan Shaw, whose sons are 3, 6, and 7. ``We shouldn't look to something that's been designed by the state as a way for us to teach our kids about their past and their future.'' 

 Fueled by a desire to rescue their children from academic failure and neglect at the hands of overburdened public schools and determined to weave tight-knit families, more African-Americans and other minorities nationwide are deciding that when it comes to school, there's no place like home. 

 This, even as they are accused of abandoning the very public school system that for decades minorities who fought to overcome separate and unequal education have been told is the ticket up and out of oppression. 

 ``Many of them have recognized that academically the public school system has not saved them,'' said Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, a nonprofit based in Oregon. 

 While there are no concrete figures, anecdotally, experts say there is a growing diversity in homeschooling. Single parents are venturing into it, and it is proving to be a sanctuary for many interracial couples. In the past, homeschooling has been a choice made mostly by white, middle-income families who could afford setting themselves apart from the traditional educational system. 

 ``Homeschooling has now become so prevalent that it has gotten to the point where it is not seen as wacky or nutty,'' Ray said. ``So it makes it easier for minorities to try it.'' 

 He estimates that there about 1.3 to 1.7 million K-12 homeschooled children nationwide, about 1 percent of those black and a lesser percentage Hispanic. ``I think over the next five years, you're going to see real growth,'' he said. 

 The rapid expansion and growth in use of the Internet also has meant plenty of inexpensive resources for homeschoolers, easing some socioeconomic barriers. A book written in 1996, ``Freedom Challenge: African American Homeschoolers,'' even features essays by 15 families that serve as a road map. 

 The interest in homeschooling is growing so much that Joyce and Eric Burges of Baker, La., are creating a national networking group that encourages African-Americans to homeschool. 

 ``My husband and I want to put a beacon of light out there that says this is an option, this is a choice you have,'' said Joyce Burges, an executive secretary who homeschools three children. Missy and Rick Parker, who have been homeschooling for 16 years, created a similar group in 1994 in Detroit. 

 ``It's a matter of commitment,'' said Missy Parker, a Southern Baptist who homeschools to teach religious values. She estimates that at least 200 African-American families in Detroit are homeschooling. ``Most African-Americans wouldn't venture to do it because they didn't feel they were equipped. But, that's what the support group is for, so you don't have to do it on your own.'' 

 Homeschooling, however, doesn't come without challenges or criticisms as any family, black or white, knows. These include fear of the unknown, lack of support from relatives and friends, financial belt-tightening and questions about the legitimacy of homeschooling. 

 And for African-Americans the accusation of black flight. 

 ``Anything that we take away from the public schools, especially in the cities has a detrimental effect,'' said Steven C. Leonard, headmaster of the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester. ``I would much rather have minority parents, black parents, all parents, fight to strengthen the public shcool systems because like it or not that's where the bulk of the students who compose our future will be educated.'' 

 Other African-American educators believe students lose something when parents chose to school at home. 

 ``One of the great benefits of public schooling is that we teach people, children how to both ask for help from others as well as to give help to others who need it,'' said Charles Willie, a Harvard professor emeritus and one of the designers of Boston public school's controlled-choice assignment plan. ``These are valuable learnings that are difficult to replace in an isolated learning environment'' 

 Still, minorities are choosing to homeschool for reasons as diverse as the ways in which they are teaching their children. 

 Some, like the Shaws, say the public school system is failing African-American children, who often end up at the bottom of achievement assessments. Results by race on the 1999 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System showed black and Latino students behind whites in every category for every grade. 

 In contrast, the Shaws point to a 1997 study by Ray and the Home School Legal Defense Association showing less of a disparity between achievement rates in math and reading among minority and white homeschoolers. 

 In addition, lamenting the loss of close-knit black communities, some parents say homeschooling allows them to fortify their children in nuturing environments. 

 ``This early stage is critical to establishing what is important, what we believe in,'' said Alan Shaw, a computer consultant who works from home. 

 Some, like Kevin Brooks, a divorced father in Arlington, say they are homeschooling to compensate for school systems that allow too many children to fall through the cracks. 

 Brooks, a researcher for Motorola, pulled his 14-year-old son Kristoff out of public school in February when he found he was spending hours trying to help his son through course work the youth should have already mastered. This year, Brooks also plans to homeschool Kristoff's twin sister. 

 He uses a network of friends, black and white, to help teach Kristoff. ``One of my challenges, and it will increase, is feeling comfortable having someone who isn't black talk to my kids about issues of race one-on-one,'' said Brooks, who shares custody with his formerwife. 

 During a recent homeschooling session, one of Brook's white friends and Kristoff had a complex conversation on how black people are sometimes portrayed negatively in cartoons. It taught Brooks a lesson: ``When you are learning from the world, outside the classroom system, you are exposed to more things,'' he said. ``So talking about stuff is a lot more important now.'' 

 From the moment that Beverley Foreman, a Jamaica native, set foot in this country in 1976, she had trouble with traditional schools. It started with her youngest son, who at 5 was already at a second-grade level, able to read and write in cursive. Here, he was placed in kindergarten and put in a corner to play with blocks, she said. 

 ``He became so distracted and disinterested in school,'' she said, and watched as he was bused out of his community to a school with special needs students, and told her son might have attention deficit disorder. 

 He eventually graduated high school, but after that Foreman pulled her other children out of public schools. The Maynard mother of four boys was ``terrified'' when she began homeschooling seven years ago, but she got over her fear and is still homeschooling her youngest son using libraries and museums as classrooms. 

 The teachable moments, insist the families, proves it is worth it over and over again. The Shaws, for example, were there when one son assumed God was white. They told him God has no color but people generally project on Him an image with which they identify. 

 And while it was their parents' choice, some minority homeschool children also applaud the move. 

 Candace Burges, 15, values the one-on-one attention. ``If I were in school now, the average teacher has to teach about 30 kids in one classroom. With my mom, it's only three,'' she said. 

 And self-esteem, Burges said, is nurtured at home. ``Sometimes African-American students are underestimated in school and they are teased and people really don't know who they really are,'' she said. 

 Alan Shaw, who attended public schools, says he never envisioned homeschooling his children. But, back in college he was one to go against the grain, he said. 

 ``I've always been hoping there would be some alternative to mainstream life,'' Shaw said. He found it at home.
