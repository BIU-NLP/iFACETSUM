Just as historical debates are revisited from time to time, so is the seemingly age-old debate about how the origin of man should be taught in the classroom. 

 On the one hand, groups like the National Academy of Sciences say that evolution should be taught with no mention of the biblical version of creation. 

 On the other hand, some church leaders say they want creation science offered as an alternative to the cut-and-dried theory of natural selection, which holds that species emerge over time. 

 The National Academy of Sciences published a book this year reiterating its 15-year-old position that the theory of evolution _ and not religious beliefs _ should be taught in every public school biology classroom. 

 Yet this time, the academy provided examples of how a person can believe in God and still believe in evolution _ a position many religious scholars would agree with. 

 ``I don't think in any way that science is at odds with the Bible,'' said Jeb Airey, pastor of the North Arlington Christian Center in Arlington, Texas. ``I think that science is a complement to the Bible.'' 

 Further, there is a false belief by some that religious people can't be scientific, said Scott Youngblood, president of the Arlington Ministerial Association and pastor of St. Barnabas United Methodist Church in Arlington. 

 ``There's this misinterpretation that somehow you can't be smart and religious at the same time, and I think that not to be the case,'' Youngblood said. ``Every theory has holes; many scientists acknowledge the mystery in it to be God.'' 

 Considered the nation's pre-eminent scientific organization, the National Academy of Sciences was chartered by Congress in 1863 to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. 

 The academy's new book, designed for ministers, parents and anyone interested in the issue of teaching evolution, follows last year's release of another National Academy of Sciences publication specifically designed to show teachers how to explain evolution and how to answer questions about creation _ complete with mock conversations. 

 ``It's kind of a one-two punch,'' said Eugenie Scott, executive director of the El Cerrito, Calif.-based National Center for Science Education, who sat on the steering committee for both publications. 

 Several local biology teachers say the issue has never been contentious in their classrooms. 

 Jim Davis has taught biology at Lamar High School in Arlington for 10 years and has spent about 24 years in the classroom. He describes himself as a Christian and believes the Bible is a work written by men but inspired by God. 

 ``I do believe in Jesus Christ,'' Davis said. ``The first thing I think about at the beginning of the day is to try to pattern my life after Christ.'' 

 Yet, he said he can't deny the scientific evidence from carbon dating and fossils that humans existed several million years ago. 

 Davis said the discussions about evolution have come up often in his classroom through the years. He occasionally finds himself answering the question: ``If man really came from apes, then why are apes still here?'' 

 He said he patiently explains that scientists have found evidence not that humans came from apes but that apes and humans evolved from a common ancestor. 

 Surprisingly, he said, the students rarely get upset. 

 ``I try to always present the information and let the kids make their own choice. If they ask my opinion, I tell them,'' he said. ``As a science teacher and a Christian, I never belittle anyone or make them feel bad when we talk about evolution. It's too important of a topic.'' 

 Youngblood, however, said it's not that easy for many Christian teachers. 

 ``The majority of our teachers are Christians,'' he said. ``They are following as best they can the guidelines they've been given not to teach religion. For most of our teachers, that puts them from time to time in a bit of a conflict.''

 ``It is the first week of classes at Central High School. As the bell rings for third period, Karen, the newest teacher on the faculty, walks into the teachers' lounge. She greets her colleagues, Barbara and Doug ... 

 ``By the way, Barbara, thanks for letting me see your syllabus for Bio I. But I wanted to ask you about teaching evolution. I didn't see it there.'' 

 ``You didn't see it on my syllabus because it's not a separate topic,'' Barbara said. ``I use evolution as a theme to tie the course together, so it comes into just about every unit. You'll see a section called `History of Life' on the second page, and there's a section called `Natural Selection.' But I don't treat evolution separately because it is related to almost every other topic in biology.'' 

 ``Wait a minute, Barbara,'' Doug says. ``Is that good advice for a new teacher? I mean, evolution is a controversial subject, and a lot of us don't get around to teaching it. I don't. You do, but you're braver than most of us.'' 

 ``It's not a matter of bravery, Doug,'' Barbara replies. ``It's a matter of what needs to be taught if we want students to understand biology. Teaching biology without evolution would be like teaching civics and never mentioning the United States Constitution ...''''
