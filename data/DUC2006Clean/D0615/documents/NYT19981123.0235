RENO, Nev. _ Cissy Bennett, a high school biology teacher in Birmingham, Ala., has to use a textbook with a disclaimer in it. 

 ``Evolution,'' says the message from the Alabama State Board of Education, ``is a controversial theory some scientists present as scientific explanation for the origin of living things, such as plants, animals and humans. No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.'' 

 That does not deter Ms. Bennett from teaching her students that humans and all other species developed from common ancestors under the influence of natural selection. ``I tell them on the first day, `We are going to learn about evolution,' '' she said. `` `I do not care if you believe what I am saying, but you will learn.' '' 

 But some teachers are more intimidated by the disclaimer. One colleague, Ms. Bennett said, once told her that she thought teaching evolution was against the law. 

 It has been 73 years since another high school biology teacher, John Scopes, was found guilty under Tennessee law for teaching that humans and apes descended from a common ancestor, and 30 years since the United States Supreme Court essentially overturned the Scopes ruling and declared that states could not prohibit teachers from discussing evolution. 

 But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution. 

 ``The evolution-creation controversy is as charged today as it was when Scopes was tried,'' said Randy Moore, a professor of biology at Louisville University in Kentucky and the editor of The American Biology Teacher, a magazine published by the National Association of Biology Teachers. ``Creationists are more powerful than ever. They're winning, not in terms of courts cases, but what happens in classrooms. I get three to five phone calls a week from teachers with problems.'' 

 A recent caller, Moore said, told him that a high school principal in Louisville had used the public address system in his school to announce that evolution had been overthrown and no longer needed to be taught. 

 Faced with incidents like these, teachers of evolution have been in ``a defensive mode,'' said Wayne Carley, executive director of the 7,500-member biology teachers association. 

 The association and other groups like the National Academy of Sciences and the largest professional group of evolutionists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, are embarking on a concerted effort to change the way Americans view evolution. 

 Evolution was at the center of the biology teachers' annual convention, which brought Moore and Ms. Bennett and about 1,500 other teachers to Reno this month. Teachers heard about the latest challenges in the classroom, received a copy of a book published earlier this year by the National Academy of Sciences about teaching evolution, and crowded into more than a dozen workshops on teaching the theory. 

 ``When you combine the lack of emphasis on evolution in kindergarten through 12th grade, with the immense popularity of creationism among the public, and the industry of discrediting evolution,'' Moore said, ``it's easy to see why half of the population believes humans were created 10,000 years ago and lived with dinosaurs. It is by far the biggest failure of science education from top to bottom.'' 

 The challenges to teaching evolution have changed, said Dr. Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, which monitors the teaching of creationism in schools and communities nationwide. The latest wrinkle, Scott said, is to try to introduce into the classroom other theories like ``intelligent design'' _ the idea that the universe is so impossibly complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an omniscient creator. 

 Creationism ranges from literal interpretations of Genesis in the Bible to the belief that God created and set in motion the process of evolution itself, a view shared by up to 40 percent of scientists according to national surveys. 

 Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who has written four books attacking ``the dogmatic teaching of Darwinian evolution,'' advocates that students be taught to be distrustful of the evolution theory. 

 Johnson is affiliated with Access Research Network, a group in Colorado Springs, Colo., that promotes intelligent design in the biology textbook ``Of Pandas and People.'' 

 At the convention, some sessions featured well-established lessons like comparing early hominid skulls and fossil footprints to the heads and feet of students in classes. But other workshops discussed current research in evolutionary biology and how the latest findings could be used to add new life to lessons.

 The Human Genome Project, for example, is finding an increasing number of genes that are shared by different species, from worms to mice to humans. 

 The ability of bacteria that cause infections to become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and the resistance insects develop to pesticides offer real life examples of evolution. 

 Teachers were even shown a case where HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, developed a resistance to different drugs within a patient suffering from the disease. 

 The association honored two high school science teachers who served on the front lines in the legal fight to teach evolution. Susan Epperson of Arkansas and Don Aguillard of Louisiana both took legal cases to the United States Supreme Court. Epperson vs. Arkansas outlawed state bans on teaching evolution in 1968, and in Edwards vs. Aguillard, the Court ruled in 1987 that states could not require that ``creation science'' be taught along with evolution. 

 The two teachers, who volunteered to serve in these test cases, have become folk heroes to some biology teachers. They have been stopped in the halls to autograph programs and have their pictures taken. But despite their legal victories, Ms. Epperson and Aguillard warned that the battle goes on. 

 ``The fight has shifted from people like Susan and myself to you,'' Aguillard told the teachers. ``The task has shifted from constitutional challenges to grass roots efforts.'' 

 In a recent survey of 387 Louisiana biology teachers, Aguillard found that 24 percent believed in creationism and 29 percent believed it was appropriate for high school biology classes. Some teachers he interviewed said they ignored evolution, and one told Aguillard, ``I try to poke as many holes in it as I can.'' 

 To Aguillard and others in the biology teachers association those findings, which echo previous studies in other states, indicate that creationism is not fading away, but is itself evolving. 

 The center for science education is involved in a court case challenging a school board resolution in Tangipahoa, La., that instructs teachers to read a disclaimer recommending that students consider ``other concepts'' than evolution. 

 The center is also mulling a legal challenge to the Alabama disclaimer, but that may be tough, said Scott, because the warning is written with finesse. ``This is bad science, and the First Amendment doesn't protect us from bad science,'' she said. ``We would have to convince a judge that it is a disguised sectarian religious view.'' 

 Cissy Bennett, for one, is not sure that a legal challenge is the way to go. People are tired of the controversy, she said. Biology teachers in Alabama won a fight to get decent textbooks that include evolution. The disclaimer ``seemed like a good compromise,'' she said, adding: ``We're able to get around it. Most teachers just teach their stuff and ignore it.'' 

 At their annual meeting, biology teachers shared strategies for dealing with problems in class. Most start their classes by discussing the differences between science and religion, and talk about the limits of science and the fact that theories are always subject to correction and change. 

 Some teachers acknowledge their own faiths and offer to talk with students outside class. Most have found ways to go on teaching evolution. 

 ``You don't change very many minds,'' said Greg Wickett, a 10th grade biology teacher in Oregon. ``When a kid is 15 years old, of course his minister and parents are influencing him more than his teachers. That's how it should be. I've had students who called me the devil. I told them I wasn't trying to convert them. I'm not trying to teach them religion.'' 

 Dr. Irene Eckstrand, who heads a new education committee of the Society for the Study of Evolution, says she believes it is almost inevitable that teachers will be defensive. ``They're held accountable to so many people,'' said Dr. Eckstrand, whose group is working with the teachers association to integrate new research into classes. ``Teachers are on the front line. But I'd like to see us not be so defensive. We have a wonderful story to tell.''
