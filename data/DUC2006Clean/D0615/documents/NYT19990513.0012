TOPEKA, Kan. _ Struggling to avoid a deadlock, the 10 Kansas Board of Education members on Wednesday left hanging the question of whether to accept science standards designating evolution as the foundation of biology. 

 The standards, written by a state committee of science teachers and university professors, would determine what Kansas schoolchildren learn and are tested on. They list evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines. 

 A competing set of standards presented by conservative board member Steve Abrams on Wednesday would remove the emphasis on evolution and insert ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.'' 

 Those standards were written by ``various citizens,'' including members of a local creation-science group. 

 For two hours the board questioned the state committee and Abrams. 

 Some board members questioned why the committee based its work on standards written by a national science group. 

 Others asked Abrams, of Arkansas City, why he did not include the names of the people who wrote his proposal; the only names on the document were those of the science committee members. 

 As the discussion ended, board Chairwoman Linda Holloway of Shawnee said she was unwilling to put the matter to a vote when it was clear that board opinions were split. 

 ``The decision rests with this board, and this is where the wrestling will have to come,'' Holloway said. ``The responsibility ultimately rests with these 10 members.'' 

 According to the board's schedule, the board is to vote on the standards in June. But Holloway said she was sure the board would not be ready to vote that soon. 

 The debate stems from a 1997 vote by the board for new standards in all subject areas. The science standards committee, appointed in part by board members, has met 12 times since last June, co-chairman Loren Lutes of Elkhart told the board. 

 Lutes, superintendent of the Elkhart School District, told the board that the committee used guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences to frame the Kansas standards. Lutes said those guidelines ``represent, in our opinion, a consensus of what is right for science education.'' 

 Before arriving at the state board for discussion, the proposed Kansas standards had been through eight public hearings and were reviewed by the Council for Basic Education, based in Washington. The fourth draft reflected the group's criticisms and public comments, Lutes said. 

 Lutes said his committee had reviewed the Abrams version and found a fundamental difference in how the two documents defined science. Board member Scott Hill of Abilene, a conservative, said the differences were unclear. 

 Committee member Brad Williamson said the difference lay in how the two sets of standards treated scientific theory. The committee's version says a theory such as evolution paints a big picture of how the natural world works. Abrams' proposal casts theory as conjecture, placing applied science above understanding how things work, said Williamson, an Olathe East High School science teacher. 

 ``Science tries to figure out what's out there,'' Williamson said. ``That's the point I'd like to share with my kids, and that's taken away from me in (Abrams') document.'' 

 Abrams, a veterinarian, said later in the discussion that he pushed for alternate standards because the committee's work did not reflect his view of good science. He said he did not find in the document his understanding that all scientific theories must be observable, measurable, testable and falsifiable. To him, evolution is none of these things. 

 Abrams denied the accusations of several speakers who on Tuesday called his proposal an attempt to push religion into the schools. He said the proposal's intent in mentioning intelligent design was to acknowledge that more than one theory existed on life's origins. 

 Some members suggested that Abrams and the science committee work out a compromise. Lutes, the committee co-chairman, said he was unwilling to integrate the Abrams proposal into the committee's standards. If the board asks him to, he will resign, and so will many committee members, Lutes said. 

 The committee meets Monday in Salina to discuss its next step, Lutes said after the board meeting. 

 ``As long as the board continues to let us do our work, we're going to do it,'' Lutes said. ``When the board takes over our job, we're going to give it to them.'' 

 The board members said repeatedly they wanted consensus on the standards. In the last two years the board has deadlocked along conservative-moderate lines over state tests, math standards and some federal programs. 

 The 5-5 split continued after November's elections, but the board agreed in January to find common ground. In March, for example, members unanimously approved new math standards almost a year after they appeared before the previous board. 

 As the discussion Wednesday ended, Holloway spoke. She said one aspect of the Abrams proposal that touched her was a statement that ``the cause of science or education (cannot) be served well by censoring, ridiculing or in any other way discouraging students from proposing and defending alternate theories.'' 

 In the board's open forum Tuesday, some speakers accused Holloway, a Christian conservative, of attempting to impose her religious beliefs on public education. 

 ``My faith was personally attacked yesterday,'' Holloway said, her voice breaking. ``I don't want that for any child in the state of Kansas. 

 ``We see what ridicule can lead to in Littleton. I don't want any child or staff member to be ridiculed because they have a faith that might be different from a prevailing theory.''
