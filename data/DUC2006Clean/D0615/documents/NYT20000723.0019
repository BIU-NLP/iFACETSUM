Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, doesn't believe in evolution. 

 He doesn't (beginitalic)believe(enditalic) in gravity either. 

 If that sounds heretical for a man of science, Johanson says that evolution is ``not a matter of belief. It's a matter of fact.'' 

 Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern biology. It is one of the most widely accepted notions in science, ranking alongside gravity, the heliocentric view of the solar system (planets revolve around the sun) and the roundness of Earth. 

 Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his 1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species. 

 (enditalic) Darwin said that life on Earth began with simple organisms and evolved into more sophisticated species over many thousands of years through a process called natural selection. Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic characteristics to their offspring. 

 To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible, Genesis. God created all species simultaneously, the world was completed in six days and humans descended from Adam and Eve - not earlier primates. 

 This month marks the 75th anniversary of the most celebrated debate between those theories - the Scopes ``monkey'' trial, in which a young Tennessee science teacher was prosecuted for violating the state's prohibition against teaching evolution. He was convicted but fined only $100, and the law was eventually repealed. 

 The controversy did not end there. 

 Scientists before Darwin had speculated about the diversity of life. But it wasn't until such publications as (beginitalic)Origin of Species (enditalic)defined the concept of natural selection that the process was made clear. Darwin's book sold out in one day. Almost immediately, scientists and then the public applauded his principles as sound though incomplete. Over the past century and a half, those principles have been even more solidly established, says Jane Maienschein, professor of biology and philosophy at ASU. 

 ``It's becoming more strongly confirmed as basic to science,'' she says. 

 In some ways, it is even better understood than gravity. 

 ``Evolution explains everything about life,'' says ASU genetics professor Elliott Goldstein. 

 By the turn of the century, evolution was generally accepted and had found its way into America's classrooms. Then religious leaders began a crusade. Accepted for the most part overseas, evolution has had a roller coaster ride in the United States. Last year the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. 

 In Arizona schools, teaching evolution is allowed, but some teachers who fear protests decline. Legislators from time to time try to ban evolution or include creationism. 

 Why the battle? 

 ``We've done a poor job of explaining it,'' says Goldstein. ``That's it in a nutshell.'' 

 Maienschein agrees. Anti-evolutionists insist the term ``theory of evolution'' suggests scientists are uncertain of the facts. But the word ``theory'' does not mean ``guess,'' she says. Scientists define theory as a series of provable facts, an organizing framework that has predictions and is testable. 

 Darwin was not the first scientist to shake the faithful. In the 16th century, Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forth the startling notion that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of the reverse. Alarmed citizens of the Earth feared that God would not be able to find them if their planet were constantly moving. 

 To remove Earth from the center of the solar system was disturbing enough, but then Darwin removed humans from the center of the animal kingdom. The Bible taught that man was given dominion over the creatures of the Earth. Darwin's ideas instead put man on a par with every creature from gnats to whales. 

 Darwin, who followed the tenets of the Church of England as well as Unitarianism, was a reluctant prophet. Knowing his findings would be unsettling, he published his research only at the urging of his wife. 

 At the same time, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was developing rudimentary theories of genetics, though they would largely be ignored until scientists rediscovered his work around 1900. The field of genetics took root in the 1930s, building on Darwin's studies and reinforcing evidence seen but not yet explained. 

 While some people find belief in a divine creator easier than understanding genes and chromosomes, Goldstein sees science and faith as compatible. He equates God's work with the forces of nature and sees the Bible not as a scientific textbook but as a metaphor. 

 ``I believe the Bible is God-inspired,'' Goldstein says. ``To believe in God doesn't mean you have to believe in creationism.'' 

 To endorse creationism, he says, is to deny nearly all scientific fields, including geology, astronomy, biology, physics and chemistry. And to deny the elegant workings of evolution is to miss the beauty of such a grand mechanism. 

 ``I feel sorry for them,'' he says of creationists. ``They're missing God's wonders because they're misinterpreting God's words.'' 

 Save the pity, says Dale Langmade, president of the Arizona Origin Science Association. ``He doesn't need to feel sorry for me, because I can see the same beauty in intelligent design.'' 

 Fundamental Christians like Langmade take the Bible literally in its explanation of the creation of the universe, he says, though some agree the Earth is older than 6,000 years. Some support the notion of natural selection as one of God's tools. 

 Langmade, who attended ASU and the University of Alaska, takes exception to the idea that creationists cannot embrace the panorama of science if they reject evolution. 

 ``That's a cheap shot,'' he says, noting that such legendary scientists as Copernicus, Galileo, Isaac Newton and Francis Crick were men of faith. 

 Langmade has spent time admiring the strata in the walls of the Grand Canyon, which he calls evidence of the Biblical account of the Great Flood. God put humans in charge of the animal kingdom, he says, because they were created in God's image: ``Man is the image of God, not flies.'' 

 But what most disturbs anti-evolutionists is that the theory appears to remove God from life's equation. Larry Kisner, a retired physicist in the aerospace industry and editor of the Arizona Origin Science Association newsletter, believes a secular explanation of the origin of the universe negates moral absolutes. He points out that evolution has been used to justify eugenics and racism. 

 ``Evolution is also a religion,'' Kisner says. ``It's paganism.'' 

 And there's a reason that America more than Europe champions the crusade against what has been dubbed ``evil-ution.'' 

 ``America has been the moral agent of the world for many generations,'' Kisner says. ``We were founded that way. {hellip} That's why the battle is fiercer here.'' 

 Scientists are waging their own battle, fearing America suffers if evolution is not taught in schools. The public must be informed on such issues as genetic research, the overuse of antibiotics, the human genome project - all of which are built upon evolutionary principles, Maienschein says. 

 Yet a poll commissioned by the liberal civil rights group People for the American Way found that while 83percent of Americans favor teaching evolution in public schools, 79percent think creationism also has a place in the classroom. 

 Such reports are ``good news and bad news,'' says science writer Jonathan Weiner, whose book, (beginitalic)The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time(enditalic), won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. Weiner takes heart that a majority of respondents support the teaching of evolution, and he does believe students should learn that some religious beliefs dispute those teachings. 

 But, he says, ``Every educated person should know and understand the theory of evolution. It's such a beautiful theory.'' 

 Weiner understands why this is a sometimes frightening period in scientific history. Cloning, gene therapy, genetic engineering - where does it stop? Will scientists some day construct human beings not just with a choice of hair and eye color but with specific behavioral and personality traits as well? 

 Evolution is sometimes taken as a symbol of science run amok. In times of uncertainty, Weiner says, people embrace the familiar and reject notions that appear too revolutionary. Creationists want to halt the revolution. 

 ``What's at stake here is the future of our children, our society and our world if our children are taught that there is no God or that they must compartmentalize their faith from school,'' Kisner says. 

 Maienschein argues that evolution will be the savior of a fragile world. 

 ``We can screw up the environment and then save it,'' she says. ``That's a source of hope.'' Tim Koors/The Arizona RepublicIs a 3 million-year-old male skull on display at the Institute of Human Origins in Tempe an ancestor of modern man?
