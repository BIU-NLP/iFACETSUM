PRATT, Kan. _ Despite controversy and confusion swirling around her like dust devils in the wheat fields, Lu Bitter, a science teacher at Pratt High School, is clear about one thing: She will continue teaching the theory of evolution, as she has for 27 years, until she is ordered to stop. 

 And if she was a betting woman, she would wager that across the state, science and biology teachers will do the same, despite the recent decision by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove any mention of evolution from the state's new science curriculum. 

 Anything beyond that is, well, evolving. 

 Two weeks after the state board threw science education in this state into turmoil and reignited a perennial debate about whether evolutionary theory or creationism has a place in American classrooms, teachers and administrators in 304 school districts across Kansas still are trying to determine what effect the decision will have on them. 

 Rather than banning outright the teaching of evolution and anything related to it, such as the origin of the universe, the board, in what was described as a compromise, opted to leave it it up to local school districts to decide if those subjects would be included in their curricula. It also ruled that no questions on evolution will be included in standardized tests. 

 In some school districts, this is a problem to face down the road when they get around to revising their science curricula. But in some, such as Pratt, which was in the process of doing so when the state board acted, it has become a volatile, potentially divisive issue. 

 ``I honestly can't tell you what is going to happen here, mostly because we haven't seen anything from the state yet,'' said Bitter. ``When we get the standards from the state, we might have some other theories mentioned more, but I don't think we are going to have to teach creationism.'' 

 Maybe not. But the teachers in Pratt may have to teach something closely akin to it. 

 Ten days before the state board's controversial vote, a small group of parents in Pratt appeared before the local school board and requested that a book titled ``Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins'' be included in the list of science textbooks to be considered for the proposed new curriculum. 

 On one level, it was a legitimate request by parents seeking input into what books should be used in the classrooms of their schools. But coming, as it did, so close to the state board's decision, the request raised questions about whether Pratt, a town of about 7,000, will become one of the newest battlegrounds in a war that began nearly three-quarters of a century ago when a teacher in Tennessee by the name of John Scopes was convicted of the crime of teaching evolution. 

 That conviction was overturned and eventually led to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that teaching creationism violated the constitutional separation of church and state. 

 ``Of Pandas and People'' does not posit God as the creator. It is ostensibly a textbook that promotes the theory of ``intelligent design,'' or the idea that life is so complex and miraculous that it could not have come about without the guidance of a master architect, or some intelligent force. 

 But it also is widely believed to be the textbook of the creationists who have tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce it to schoolbook lists in Idaho, Alabama and Texas and who have sold it to local school districts in several states. The book is considered by the National Association of Biology Teachers, among others, to be little more than creation theory minus the ``creator.'' 

 Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented ``Of Pandas and People'' to the Pratt school board early this month, insisted that there is no hidden agenda in his attempts to get the book on the textbook lists. He also insisted that the timing of his presentation was coincidental to the action by the state board. 

 ``We recommended `Of Pandas and People' be used as a supplemental textbook because it provides another interpretation of the same scientific evidence,'' Mammoliti said. ``We made it clear that we did not want evolution taken out of the curriculum and that we thought it important that evolution continue to be taught. We just think it should be taught in a less dogmatic way.'' 

 There are seven people on the Pratt school district board. Two, including board President Willa Beth Mills, who reportedly hopes to see elements of creationism included in the district's science curriculum, supported including ``Of Pandas and People.'' The other five have not revealed their thinking. 

 Which, inevitably, in a small town like Pratt, has led to much speculation. 

 ``We simply don't know what they (the board) are going to do,'' said Bitter, whose husband was a former president of the board. 

 Andy Koenigs, the assistant superintendent for Pratt schools, sought to downplay any suggestion that the creationism vs. evolution issue was causing divisions within the community. However he acknowledged that the state board's actions two weeks ago had compromised the district's efforts to write a new science curriculum. 

 ``Our curriculum is on pause until we get the standards from the state,'' Koenigs said. ``I know that one side of this issue (those opposed to the teaching of evolution) is claiming a big victory, but my prediction is that many of the school districts will continue to teach evolution.'' 

 Koenigs also downplayed the importance of the theoretical creationism/evolution debate to the practicalities of teaching, pointing out that in Pratt evolution takes up no more than three days out of the school year. 

 ``It's much ado about nothing,'' he said. 

 Before retiring, Janell Mead spent 20 years teaching evolution at Pratt High School without community objection. In fact, she said, the only real controversy to hit the campus before the last few weeks was when ``secular humanism'' was debated. And even that was dropped before it became a divisive issue. 

 Mead, who studied genetics and evolution in college, said she was concerned that those in the community, like herself, who argued against creationism would be branded as un-Christian. 

 ``We are not anti-Christian,'' she said. ``I teach Sunday school. I know I'm not an atheist. In fact I don't think I know any atheists. I would like to think that they (the creationists in the community) are a vocal minority, but I don't know.'' 

 Many school districts across Kansas have gone on the record that despite the action by the state board, they will continue to include the teaching of evolution and related subjects in their curricula. 

 But Mead and Bitter, both veteran teachers with standing in their community, and other pro-evolutionists expressed concern about the effect of the board's action in smaller, more fundamentally religious communities. 

 ``Eighty percent of the biology teachers in this state are in small towns,'' said Steve Case, the coordinator for the Kansas Collaborative Research Network, an Internet research resource, and one of the members of the team that wrote the original state science standards. 

 ``Are we going to expect a teacher in a particularly religious, pro-creationist community to stand up and say that evolution is science and should be taught? I think a lot of teachers are going to take the path of least resistance and bow to the local pressure.''
