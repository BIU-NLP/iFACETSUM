FLORENCE, Ky. _ Since dedicating himself to creationism 20 years ago when he was a disillusioned science teacher in Australia, Ken Ham has found that progress generally can be slow, but hardly as slow as his evolutionist adversaries would have the world believe. 

 After moving to America five years ago, Ham, a dedicated Christian fundamentalist with an Abe Lincoln gaze to his musings about the origin of life, now directs a $5-million-a-year enterprise and claims to have 110 ``creation clubs'' in schools across the country. He expects more as he spreads the literal word according to Genesis _ that creation was a divine accomplishment in six days _ and tries to debunk the teaching of evolution. 

 This would seem an uphill struggle, but Ham takes comfort that the phones and Web site of his nonprofit organization, Answers in Genesis Inc., are still busy with the stir created by creationism's biggest victory to date _ the Kansas Board of Education's decision last August to yield to growing pressure and delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. 

 This was followed last month by the decision of state education officials here in Kentucky to eliminate the word ``evolution'' but not the scientific theory of evolution from the school curriculum and to substitute the phrase ``change over time.'' In Oklahoma, officials recently ordered that textbooks must bear a disclaimer about the certainty of evolution. On the other hand, New Mexico's Board of Education voted last month to bar creationism and overwhelmingly endorse evolution in the science curriculum. 

 ``This whole battle is hotting up,'' Ham summarized amid some glaring, gaping full-sized dinosaur models scattered about his headquarters like an oddly dissenting chorus on the phylogenetic scale. Ham uses the mystery about the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from creation as an argument against evolution. He is planning to build a creationist museum north of here near Cincinnati, full of naturalist displays presenting ``creation science'' arguments that creation was accomplished 6,000 years ago. 

 Under the theory of evolution, rooted in a myriad of fossil, anatomic and genetic evidence, the scientific consensus is that life began on earth around 3.9 billion years ago, with humans and other species evolving from a common ancestor. Ham has his own staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other underpinnings of modern science. 

 ``I see a culture war hotting up in America between Christian morality and relative morality, which is really the difference between a creation-based philosophy and an evolution-based one,'' said Ham, who argues that if the word ``day'' in Genesis' account of creation is allowed to be taken metaphorically to encompass eons and to blur divinity's role, then the Bible is made fallible and morality reduced to human whim. 

 Whether or not America is ready for such a culture war of words, Ham is. His group claims 140,000 on its mailing list and more than 3,000 visitors a day to its Web site at www.answersingenesis.org. H says the organization is growing as political leaders are more tempted to tinker with accepted notions about evolution. Supported by donations and fees on a wide array of handsomely produced recordings and publications, Answers in Genesis holds seminars across the country, offering counterarguments to evolution. It offers not outright Christian fundamentalism, but ``a supplement to the church,'' in Ham's view. 

 Teachers who sponsor the creation clubs must sign a commitment to ``the inerrant word of God.'' As a nonprofit group, his organization does not lobby government. But it presents information to anyone who asks, and Ham happily claims that some Kansas officials involved in the curriculum decision are quite familiar with his publications. 

 ``I'm very encouraged,'' said Ham, the director of one of the nation's two dominant creationist groups. The other is the Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, where Ham once worked. He decided to strike out on his own into what he says is a growing field of intellectual challenge, but what his critics say is a fundamentalist protest niche far more lucrative than enlightening. 

 ``We're having a rash of statewide problems,'' said Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, the main grass-roots science group active against creationism, with 4,000 members. While creation clubs are entitled to free speech, Ms. Scott said, they prepare adherents with flurries of classroom challenges that ``tend to discourage the teaching of evolution.'' 

 In reaction to creationist assaults, the National Science Teachers Association, with 53,000 teachers, has begun holding information sessions at its state conventions this fall to prepare teachers to lead their communities in defending evolution as vital to a proper education. 

 Ken Rosenbaum, a Kentucky science teacher, rankles at ``change over time'' as the state's official new euphemism for evolution. He expects his state Science Teachers Association, of which he is executive director, will soon come out firmly behind evolution. ``Put a nail outside and it will rust,'' Rosenbaum commented, teacherlike. ``That's change over time. But is it evolution?'' 

 Ham is only further encouraged by the evolutionists' rallying to their cause as his own speaking engagements grow. ``I was trained in a Christian home by a father always prepared to defend his faith in a logical way,'' he said. 

 ``I saw him do that over and over against liberal theology,'' said Ham, confidently patting the synthetic hide of a large dinosaur being prepared for the future museum of creationism. The information card of the extinct creature offered the standard natural history pedigree, with an added notation: ``Created Day Six.''
