BOSTON _ What a contradictory country this is. More than any other, it has always been open to new ideas, to change. Looking to the future instead of the past, it has made itself a great force, not just in world markets but in the world of ideas. Yet there is also an America locked in rigid certainties and shibboleths. 

 That other part of our divided national character, the second America, is displayed in the effort to put the Bible ahead of science in schools. The advocates speak of ``creation science,'' replacing the Darwinian theory that life forms evolved over millions of years with the biblical account that God created the earth and its creatures in six days. 

 Most of us thought the attempt to stifle the teaching of evolution was a fringe phenomenon. Hadn't it been effectively disabled by the Scopes trial three-quarters of a century ago? 

 Then, in August, the Kansas Board of Education voted to downgrade the teaching of evolution in public schools. A new curriculum it approved removed evolution from the state tests that students have to take. 

 The Kansas board also took aim at the science of the cosmos, voting to delete from its standards the Big Bang theory of how the universe originated around 15 billion years ago. James Glanz of The New York Times, in an article this week, called attention to the even more sweeping effects of that aspect of the board's action. 

 Creationists argue that the earth is only a few thousand years old. That view calls into question many fundamentals of science today, such as radiocarbon dating _ which shows that rocks on our planet are millions of years old. Indeed, the whole scientific understanding of the universe would have to be discarded. 

 The creationist position is certainly not a fringe belief nowadays. A Gallup poll taken in June for CNN and USA Today found that 68 percent of those surveyed favored teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools; 40 percent favored dropping evolution altogether and teaching children only the biblical version of creation. 

 High-ranking American politicians have taken to condemning the idea of evolution. After the massacre in Columbine High School in Colorado in April, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, put the blame on the teaching of children ``that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud.'' 

 The argument made against teaching evolution, in Kansas and elsewhere, is that no one was there to see how life began _ and students should be given only firsthand evidence. In Alabama, consistent with that view, all students are warned: ``No one was present when life first appeared on earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.'' 

 Of course evolution is a theory. The whole ethos of science is that any explanation for the myriad mysteries in our universe is a theory, subject to challenge and experiment. That is the scientific method. 

 Those who take the biblical account of creation literally reject the scientific method, offering instead a doctrine of faith. There are ``creation scientists'' who argue that the Bible can be squared with scientific observations of, for example, the age of the universe. But they are not taken seriously by most scientists. 

 The interesting question is why a large body of opinion in the United States supports a view at such odds with contemporary scientific understanding. No other Western country has anything like it. 

 Religious fundamentalists have played an important part in America from the earliest settlements. And religious belief is much stronger in the United States today than in other Western societies. But belief does not usually, elsewhere, lead to opposing the teaching of evolution. 

 Perhaps rejection of the scientific method reflects a turning away from unhappy aspects of our contemporary society _ greed, vulgarity and the like. Some Americans think we are, as the title of Robert Bork's book puts it, ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah.'' 

 Concern about aspects of American life is fair enough. But depriving children of the great ideas of science cannot make things better. We thought we had advanced since Galileo was silenced for advancing the theory that the earth revolves around the sun.  &QL;
