KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Kansas Board of Education member Steve Abrams called John Staver to Topeka two weeks ago, Staver thought they were going to iron out some problems with proposed science standards. 

 Instead, Abrams gave Staver, who helped write the standards, a 91-page revision. 

 And although Abrams' version was written by ``various citizens,'' including the Missouri president of a creation science group, the only names on the revision are those of Staver and the 26 other members of the state committee that wrote the original document. 

 Abrams sees his revision as one of many since the committee began writing the standards more than a year ago. But science committee members say Abrams' revision substantially changed a document that was based on guidelines from national science associations. 

 Abrams' version would change the definition of science, eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.'' 

 ``It bothers me that my name is on it,'' said Steve Case, a member of the standards committee who sits on the faculty at the University of Kansas. 

 The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of science. Without an understanding of evolution, students cannot succeed in the life sciences, the standards writers said. 

 But Abrams didn't agree, and on Wednesday he'll present his revision to the other board members. Today, the board will hear public comment on the science standards. 

 The proposed standards are the result of a state board order in 1997 to spell out what students should learn at various grade levels. The board and the state education commissioner appointed the 27-member committee to write the standards. 

 Staver, director of the Center for Science Education at Kansas State University, said the committee decided at its first meeting to base the new standards on national guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences. 

 Those national standards, developed over four years, were reviewed and critiqued by 22 science organizations. About 18,000 persons signed off on the national standards before they were accepted, Staver said. Those standards present evolution as a major component of science. 

 ``That national consensus gives the national standards a very special kind of credibility,'' Staver said. 

 At least that's what the science committee thought. But Abrams wasn't satisfied that the new state science standards represented the best kind of science. 

 Abrams, a veterinarian from Arkansas City, said science is something that is ``observable, measurable, repeatable and falsifiable.'' 

 ``It's been a standard for theories of science for hundreds of years,'' Abrams said. ``If it's not repeatable, it doesn't do any good.'' 

 For Abrams, macro-evolution _ one species of animal changing into another as it adapts to its environment _ can't be observed, measured, repeated or falsified. (Something that can be falsified can be proved or disproved by scientific experiment). 

 So when Cass County resident Tom Willis approached Abrams with a revision of the state standards, Abrams took a look. 

 Willis, president of the Creation Science Association for Mid-America, said he and about two dozen other people evaluated the proposed state science standards and found them lacking. He declined to name his co-authors. 

 Willis said he and his co-authors couldn't present new standards to the state board; that's where Abrams came in. When Abrams saw Willis' document, it was in its second draft. Abrams said he helped the writers edit and present the document in the proper format. 

 Willis said the state committee's version and Abrams' revision are quite different, but Abrams describes the changes as slight. 

 Among the differences: 

 - The committee's version lists five ``unifying concepts'' of science: systems, order and organization; evidence, models and explanation; constancy, change and measurement; form and function; and evolution and equilibrium. 

 Abrams' revision removed the unifying concepts and added three areas of science: technology, theoretical science and historical science. 

 - The committee's version defines science as ``the human activity of seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us.'' 

 In Abrams' revision, science is defined as something that can be repeated in the laboratory. 

 - The glossary of the committee's version defines evolution, in part, as ``a scientific theory that accounts for present day similarity and diversity among living organisms and changes in non-living entities over time.'' 

 The glossary of Abrams' version describes evolution as permutations that occur within a species, with the caveat that some evolutionary changes can be demonstrated and some cannot. 

 The board that will take up the standards on Wednesday is divided along ideological lines, with five moderate members and five conservatives. The two sides have deadlocked on several issues in the last few years. 

 Moderate member Janet Waugh of Kansas City, Kan., said she had no idea Abrams was working on a revision. 

 Neither did Bill Wagnon, a moderate from Topeka. Wagnon said that after he received Abrams' version of the standards, the two talked. Wagnon said he was trying to persuade Abrams to uphold the commitment he made two years ago when the science committee was appointed. 

 At that time, board members each chose a committee member to represent their views, with the rest appointed by the education commissioner. If the board can't trust its own committees, the process fails, Wagnon said. 

 ``Abrams is searching for a sixth vote,'' Wagnon said. ``I hope, if he can't find it, he will encourage others to vote for the committee's standards.'' 

 Linda Holloway, a Shawnee conservative who is chairwoman of the state board, said she was unsure what would happen if state board members voted to accept Abrams' version over the science committee's standards. The board is scheduled to vote in June on the new standards.
