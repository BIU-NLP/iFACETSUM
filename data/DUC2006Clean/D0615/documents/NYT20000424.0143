It was both tragedy and triumph that when ``On the Origin of Species'' was published in 1859, Charles Darwin's name became a synonym for evolution. Though Darwin studiously avoided mentioning humans in his book, religious leaders immediately saw ``Darwinism'' as a dangerous anti-religion, a godless belief system that removed the Creator from creation and made his greatest idea, man, the grandchild of mere apes. 

 Over time, Darwin's ideas have prevailed. Most mainstream religions have come to an accommodation with them, though a vocal minority still rejects evolution and propounds biblically-derived creationist theories. 

 The triumph of Darwin was the brilliant way the former ministry student distilled and explained the mechanism of life. His thesis of descent with modification via natural selection immediately clicked with people who took the time to consider it. So obvious was it to zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley that he exclaimed, ``How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.'' 

 But Darwin did not just cause readers to smack their heads and utter, ``Duh.'' He fundamentally changed the way all of us _ including every rejectionist, whether he admits it or not _ see the world. In ``Darwin's Ghost,'' a fascinating and witty book that tours the same intellectual territory as Darwin, Steve Jones, a British geneticist, shows how extensively Darwin's theory explains the natural world. 

 At heart, his is an argument with both the remaining skeptics of evolution and those who persist in misapplying Darwin's theory in realms such as sociology. 

 Natural selection, Jones neatly observes, is a dumb but relentless machine that works with the materials at hand. Most of its products do not last. ``Who could ever have designed a tree kangaroo?'' But ``clumsy as the animal may seem, it is infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and plainly bears the stamp of far higher workmanship, than anything achieved by man.'' Which is why engineers of recent years have been studying natural forms to tease out design ideas. 

 The more sophisticated school of creationism, of course, may see in the word ``workmanship'' a hint of ``intelligent design'' and thus of a deus in the machina of natural selection. Empty logic, says Jones. Natural selection is the ``plodding accumulation of error.'' Given enough time to work through enough mistakes, anything _ velociraptor, tree kangaroo, homo sapien _ will turn up. So why get caught up in a material-world argument, asks Jones. ``The birth of Adam, whether real or metaphorical, marked the insertion into an animal body of a post-biological soul that leaves no fossils and needs no genes.'' The flesh, he wisely notes, is not a good place to go hunting for the things of spirit. 

 A big part of Jones's book is devoted to human, as opposed to natural, selection _ the breeding programs and hybridization campaigns that humans have conducted with cattle, dogs, wheat, and a thousand more species for the past 13,000 years. Domesticated life forms, he says, are ``silent witnesses to the malleability of nature.'' 

 That very malleability, combined with human technological prowess, is why we have arrived at a portentious moment. Though he doesn't spend much time on the subject, it is clear that Jones believes human cloning and increasingly bizarre forms of hybridization are, if not now underway somewhere, certainly imminent and probably dangerous. 

 Jones does not wave the chicken-little banner of ``Frankenfood'' in this book, but here is a geneticist clearly alarmed at the dangers of genetic manipulation. Already, he points out, beneficial genes inserted into oilseed rape to promote herbicide resistance have seeped into wild mustards and radishes. ``Industry's optimism about the nature and stability of species is unfounded,'' he says. ``Those who cast down the barriers to hybridism will soon be reminded of what evolution can do.'' 

 ``Darwin's Ghost'' is written with great authority and a fluid style, and it is refreshing not to have footnotes littering the text. But Jones fails to include substantial back-of-the-book chapter notes to anchor disembodied quotes and expand upon interesting facts. It is true that light or nonexistent footnotes are more the British than the American style, but combined with breezy writing the effect on a reader is an unnecessary wobbliness about facts. 

 Then there's the conceit of this book _ the ``Darwin's ghost'' theme. It is a little misleading. Happily, Jones does not walk in Darwin's footsteps or retrace the voyage of the Beagle. That would get old fast. He properly honors Darwin throughout the book, but his republication of Darwin's chapter summaries and recapitulation seem contrived. ``Origin'' is readily available (even on the Net). Unannotated chunks of it do little good in this book. 

 Where Jones is especially good is in a quick putdown of some of the wilder claims of sociobiology. ``Evolution is a political sofa that molds itself into the buttocks of the last to sit upon it,'' he notes. Marxists and ultra-capitalists have both seized on it at times. So, too, have agenda-driven scientists and journalists. In a whack at the all-in-our-genes school, he says, ``Sexual fidelity or promiscuity seems, according to taste, the natural thing to do; families are often a joy, and patriotism arouses some, but we do not need natural selection to tell us why.'' 

 If Darwin had a ghost _ a free-floating post-biological soul _ it would enjoy that defense of his theory against the latest crop of misusers.
