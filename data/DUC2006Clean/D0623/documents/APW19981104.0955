CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ No smoking in enclosed public places except in designated areas. No tobacco advertising. Even ads for non-tobacco products would not be allowed to show people smoking cigarettes. Such is life in South Africa envisioned by one of the world's strictest anti-smoking bills, which parliament's lower house approved on Wednesday. Parliament's upper house has already passed the bill proposed by President Nelson Mandela's health minister. It must now reconsider it due to some last-minute amendments. Final passage appeared assured. ``It is just a formality,'' said one dejected lawmaker, Ruth Rabinowitz of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which voted against the bill. But tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount a constitutional challenge to the bill, which could delay it becoming law or perhaps kill it altogether. Opponents say the bill infringes individual and free-trade rights. All but one of the opposition parties in the National Assembly opposed the bill on Wednesday, but the ruling African National Congress' hefty majority ensured a victory. It was approved by 213 votes to 106. ``Fundamental fanatacism has won the day,'' rued the National Party, which ruled under apartheid and whose last president, F.W. de Klerk, was a chain smoker. Although the two sides remained deeply divided, the day had its light moments. ANC lawmaker Kader Asmal evoked laughter when he spoke in support of the bill, saying it didn't ban smoking altogether but just ``privatized pleasure.'' Asmal smoked for 50 years until giving up under a doctor's orders earlier this year. When the house speaker announced absent lawmakers would be given five minutes to appear for the vote, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel asked whether the time could be used for a smoke break. Manuel is not known to be a smoker, and he did not join a handful of lawmakers who hurried out of the chamber to sneak a quick puff below a nearby flight of stairs. Parliament banned smoking in most public areas of the building, including the area below the stairs, several months ago. During debate on Tuesday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma declared ``the social cost of continued indulgence in the destructive habit of smoking is prohibitively high.'' The bill outlaws smoking in enclosed public places like train stations and shopping malls and in the workplace. It provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are created for those desperate for a puff. Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the ban. The planned law bans all tobacco advertising and sponsorship. Even ads for products such as drinks and clothes would be banned from showing people smoking. The maximum fine for smoking at work or in public places would be 200 rand (dlrs 35). Advertising violations could generate fines of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000). Cigarette advertisements in South Africa on billboards and the print media already must prominently display such warnings as ``DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU,'' or ``DANGER: SMOKING CAUSES CANCER.'' The tobacco industry, advertising groups and some unions oppose the bill and are vowing a fight. (ph-aos)
