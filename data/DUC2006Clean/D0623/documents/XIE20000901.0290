ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lighting up in public and private indoor areas throughout Italy could draw hefty fines under a smoking ban that was formally approved Friday by Italy's cabinet. 

 The sweeping ban allows for designated smoking zones in ventilated areas, but calls for stiff fines against those who violate the ban. 

 All publicly and privately owned indoor places open to the public are covered by the bill, including bars, restaurants, prisons and police stations. 

 Owners, managers and designated "smoke-busters" who fail to apply the norms are also subject to fines though the cabinet Friday agreed to reduce the penalty. 

 The proposed fines would range from 100,000-300,000 lire (about 50-150 U.S. dollars) for anyone who lights up. 

 The ban was drafted by Italian Health Minister Umberto Veronesi and previously approved on first reading by the cabinet and by the State-Region Conference, and it will go into effect after being upheld by the parliament. 

 Veronesi, one of Europe's leading cancer specialists, has announced a crusade against smoking, saying that too many Italians still die of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke. 

 An estimated 1 million people, or 24.5 percent of the population, in Italy smoke cigarettes though figures compiled by the national statistics bureau Istat show that the percentage of smokers nationwide has fallen by nearly 1 percent since 1993. 

 According to Veronesi, the proceeds from the fines will be used to fund anti-smoking campaigns, Veronese said.
