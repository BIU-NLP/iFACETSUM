NEW YORK _ Since the city banned smoking in restaurants in 1995, restaurateurs have complained that the prohibition is bad for business. On Monday, a group of academic researchers, admittedly anti-smoking ones, released a series of six analyses suggesting that the ban has not hurt. 

 The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law, which took effect on April 10, 1995, has had no effect on local sales, job growth or income. The studies, which were financed by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program, which receives money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, showed that restaurant industry jobs rose 18 percent from 1993 to 1997, to 19,347. 

 During the same period, sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the state. The number of restaurants in the city during that period increased 6 percent. 

 At a news conference, the researchers characterized their work as the first comprehensive look at the city's ban on smoking in restaurants with 35 or more seats. They said earlier studies suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the tobacco industry. 

 ``Local officials can now go about their business of protecting the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying about this phony issue,'' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the articles, which are published in the January issue of Public Health Management and Practice. 

 Mike O'Neal, who owns O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street, near Lincoln Center, supported the ban, saying it has helped his business. ``If 75 percent of people don't smoke and 25 percent do, that means 75 percent are going to eat out more and 25 percent are going to eat out less,'' he said at the news conference. 

 Others in the restaurant industry took sharp issue with the studies' methodology and conclusions. Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a trade group, said in an interview that his group sponsored a study in 1996 that showed jobs at city restaurants declining 4 percent. He said that since his group's study examined statistics for the months just before and after the law took effect, it could isolate more fairly the ``cataclysmic'' influence of the smoking ban on business. 

 Wexler said his group's study showed retail jobs going up 2 percent at the same time that restaurant jobs dropped 4 percent, suggesting that something beyond general economic trends was at work, he said. 

 Dan Tubridy, who owns Pier 92, a restaurant in Rockaway Beach, Queens, said in an interview that he lost customers immediately. ``They said that if they couldn't eat at my place they were going to Nassau County, pure and simple,'' he said. ``And you know what happens? They don't come back.'' 

 Wexler also pointed out that 8,000 of 15,000 restaurants included in the overall sales tax figures were small enough to allow smoking or were primarily bars, where smoking is also allowed. The study conducted by Dr. Andrew Hyland, a biostatistician, and two colleagues at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, acknowledged this limitation. 

 The restaurant trade group is heavily supported by the Tobacco Institute, which recently admitted funneling $443,072 to the group, after earlier claiming a far lower amount. The money was used to lobby the state Legislature for less stringent laws than the city's. 

 The studies also concluded that the law has been enforced very effectively. An examination of city records, one study said, showed that city health inspectors found smoking at only 2 percent of the 251 restaurants they visited. Another study indicated that 90 percent of restaurant owners reported that their indoor areas were smoke-free. Three out of four restaurateurs reported that complying with the law cost them no money. 

 Several researchers said the next step would be a dual effort: to pass laws like the city's in other counties, and to extend the city law to bars, both those within restaurants and free-standing ones. ``A bar is a workplace,'' said Dr. John Seffin, chief executive of the American Cancer Society. ``You should not be allowed to smoke in a workplace.''
