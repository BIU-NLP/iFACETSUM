GERMANY: Health-conscious Germans are drinking less beer and eating leaner meat, but they still like their cigarettes. Big ``No Smoking'' signs hang at subway entrances in Berlin, but, recognizing the inevitable, there are ashtrays on the platforms. In February, parliament easily defeated the first attempt to regulate smoking nationwide. GREECE: One would never know it, but smoking is actually forbidden in public places in Greece _ where 45 percent of adults smoke _ and it has been for years. It is banned on all public transport (1952), in closed public spaces (1980), on domestic flights (1990) and in health-care facilities (1993). ``Regardless, some people abuse it,'' says Pantelis Vekios of the Health Ministry. ``It happens a lot in Greece. If your boss smokes and you can't say anything to him because he'll fire you, what can you do?'' ISRAEL: By and large, Israel has followed the United States' lead in enacting bans, but some time later. But the head of Israel radio, Amnon Nadav, refused to allow government inspectors into his building after some of his staff complained about the round-the-clock stench of nicotine. ITALY: Cigarette smoke wafts from the Coliseum in Rome, cigarette butts litter the Forum. You've come to Rome to see the sights, but the country's anti-smoking laws are, in general, blowing a lot of smoke. Two years ago, the government banned smoking in private businesses serving the public and ordered government agencies to enforce the prohibitions. Still, banks put up ``No-Smoking'' signs just a few feet from ... ashtrays. Ditto for some hospital waiting rooms. JAPAN: In Tokyo, restaurant patrons eat in a fog of tobacco smoke, a blue haze hangs over coffeehouses and workplaces reek of cigarettes. Restrictions are slowly springing up. Smokers are limited to special parts of train platforms, for example, and small no-smoking sections are becoming more common in family style eateries. MEXICO: If it isn't a smoker's paradise, it's only because the cigarettes are so bad. It's hard to walk a block in Mexico City without finding someone hawking smokes such as Marlboros or Delicados (unfiltered ``Delicate Ones''). The only places with effective bans are the movie theater, subway and public buses. NETHERLANDS: You can walk into a so-called ``coffeehouse'' and smoke marijuana or hashish without fear of arrest, so puffing on mere tobacco is tame stuff. There are no ``smoker segregation'' laws, but change is in the air. More companies are sending employees outside to smoke, and this year KLM Royal Dutch Airlines banned smoking on all flights. PORTUGAL: When entering an elevator in Lisbon, don't worry if the ashtray is full. You can stub out your cigarette on the floor like those before you. Such occurrences are much rarer than they once were, but the smoke still blows thick in Portugal _ especially in bars and restaurants. RUSSIA: Moscow has a few designated no-smoking areas, but everywhere else people smoke as they please. State officials light up in the corridors of government buildings, school teachers puff away in lounges and school stairwells, restaurants allow smoking in the dining rooms. Even in clinics and hospitals, there is little apparent concern for the dangers of smoking. But smokers may be fined if they light up on a city bus or subway. SINGAPORE: Soon smokers will have nowhere to hide. It's still safe to light up in a bar, disco, karaoke lounge and in the great outdoors. But if you are on line for a bus or a taxi with more than two other people, you'd better stub out that butt fast. All public areas, air conditioned shopping centers and shops, offices, schools, private clubs, taxis, buses and public toilets in Singapore are designated smoke-free. Smoking is also barred in underground pedestrian walkways and any lines of two or more people. The maximum fine for selling tobacco to anyone under 18 is 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,000) for the first offense, and 10,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,000) for subsequent offenses. Last year, a court sentenced a 16-year-old boy to two years in juvenile detention for repeated underage smoking. But after 28 years of increasingly restrictive laws, about 18 percent of the population still smokes. SPAIN: When dining out in Madrid, don't worry about fighting for a seat in the no-smoking section because there's no such thing. Just hold your breath and chew fast. In other public places, such as stores and public transport, smoking is banned under law but some people light up anyway. In government buildings, smoking is prohibited only in ones that deal directly with the public. TURKEY: A year after a law banned smoking in public offices, hospitals, buses and airports, people are still said to ``smoke like a Turk.'' Cinema lobbies and waiting rooms seem less hazy these days, with the nonsmoking minority policing the ban. Still, ashtrays remain under no-smoking signs to collect the butts of violators, who dare to face a 10 million turkish lira (dlrs 32) fine. UNITED KINGDOM: Pity the smoker who doesn't drink, as pubs remain a safe haven. Otherwise, British smokers increasingly are relegated to the sidewalk or the parking lot, largely at the initiative of employers, and smoking is banned in many public places including subways and trains. The government has set a target of reducing cigarette consumption by 40 percent by the year 2000. VENEZUELA: It's pretty much OK to smoke anywhere you want in Caracas and most other cities, with a few exceptions, such as hospitals and the Health Ministry. Upscale restaurants are beginning to create no-smoking sections, and there's a de facto ban on overcrowded buses because passengers are already irritated by exhaust fumes from traffic jams.
