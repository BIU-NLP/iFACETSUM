JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Smokers across South Africa will soon be hounded out of many public places because a tough clamp-down on smoking in shops and banks will be imposed, Saturday Star paper reported. 

 The controls, in terms of amendments to South Africa's tobacco laws, are due to be tabled in parliament shortly. 

 Tobacco companies are considering whether to challenge the new law in the Constitutional Court, the report said. 

 The draconian measures against smoking in public are in addition to the proposed ban on tobacco advertisements and sports sponsorship by tobacco companies. 

 The new law will enable local authorities to ban smoking in public places and to designate areas where smoking is allowed, a health spokesman of the Gauteng province was quoted as saying. 

 Gauteng, the economic powerhouse of South Africa, is gearing itself for the anti-smoking move, with regulations in the pipeline and ready to be implemented when the new law is promulgated, the spokesman said. 

 Public places are defined as gyms, banks, hotels, libraries, post offices, schools, creches, shopping malls, retail stores, theaters, cinemas and stadiums. 

 The amendments will also see a ban on smoking in municipal buildings and on public transport. 

 Recent surveys show that one in three adult South Africans smoked, and the habit is growing among teenagers, at whom much of the tobacco advertising was aimed. 

 Surveys also show that most South Africans support the state's proposal to ban smoking in public and regulate tobacco advertisement.
