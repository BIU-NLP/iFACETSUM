LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The first day of the introduction of the law which bans smoking in California's bars and nightclubs ended with mixed reactions from the public. 

 The new anti-smoking law, the strongest in the United States, went into effect in the small hours on January 1, 1998. The ban stems from California's indoor workplace smoking prohibition that started in 1994. 

 According to the new law, bar owners will be fined up to 100 U.S. dollars for the first offense and 7,000 dollars for the second violation. 

 Reporters from local newspapers based in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and other cities spent much time in New Year's Day in bars which were packed with patrons to interview with smokers, non-smokers, bar owners and policemen. 

 In some bars, smokers went right on smoking despite waitresses had confiscated ashtrays at midnight. But in other bars, customers got in their last puffs before midnight, and then the smoke cleared. 

 An organization called Californians for Smokers' Rights issued a statement on Thursday, calling for the repeal of the law. 

 The organization argued, "the law deprives smokers of the right to consume a legal product within a private establishment." 

 But other smokers seem not so assured. Although complaining and cursing the law, they smoked out of the bars. Some people also said that they would quit smoking because of the new law. 

 The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency urged residents to embrace the law and report violations. 

 Anti-smoking activists were confident that people will become accustomed to the law. 

 However, owners of bars and restaurants argued that the ban would severely hurt their business. 

 California's Health Department hoped that most bar owners and patrons would eventually comply with the new law.
