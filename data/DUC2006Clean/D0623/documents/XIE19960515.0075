BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Guihua failed to find a single smoker to fine in a big Beijing department store, even though she searched among the bustle of shoppers for several hours. 

 Sun was happy about her work anyway, saying: "It shows that almost all people know about the regulation and observe it." 

 The regulation she was referring to, which took effect today, bans smoking in public places. 

 To enforce it and to fine offenders, a small army of more than 80,000 people like Sun was sent to department stores, hospitals, schools, railway stations, and other public places. 

 The air in packed waiting rooms at the Beijing Railway Station used to be filled with smoke, but now look cleaner and smell better. 

 "I have to go outside to take a cigarette because of the 'no smoking' signs everywhere," a traveller waiting for his train said, shrugging. 

 That sign and others have been placed in easy-to-see locations on major streets, in busy shopping areas, and in public places around the city, for several months. 

 There were even people handing out millions of pamphlets on the street to make people aware of the adverse effects of smoking and advising them to avoid it. 

 "I feel relieved because I will no longer be surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke in offices and meeting rooms," said a passer-by who stopped at one information site on Chang'an Avenue. 

 A government office worker was another beneficiary of the massive anti-smoking drive: "I don't need to clean ash trays full of cigarette butts from now on, because nobody will use them anymore," she remarked while cleaning up a meeting room. 

 "I'm thinking of smoking less and trying to quit," Tian Yong, vice president of the Beijing No. 4 Middle School and a veteran of 26 years of smoking, told Xinhua. He said he thinks stopping teachers from smoking at school is vital to providing a healthy example for students.
