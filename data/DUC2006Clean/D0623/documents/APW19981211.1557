NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers on the go are always a step ahead in plotting when and where they can get that next nicotine fix. On a day-trip with the kids in the back of the car and a wife with an attitude about second-hand smoke, they finesse with frequent pit stops blamed on the bladder. But deep dread sets in when boarding a U.S. airliner and some foreign carriers, knowing there is no finesse. That's a given. But what is less defined are the anti-smoking laws in the countries you plan to visit. They vary greatly and often are winked at. Authorities in Singapore are determined to make the city-state the world's first smoke-free nation. To that end, smokers can be slapped with a dlrs 600 fine just for lighting up while waiting in line for a bus or taxi. On the other hand, smokers in Japan are allowed for the most part to light up when and where they please. Could that be because the powerful Ministry of Finance owns two-thirds of the stock in Japan Tobacco, which controls nearly 80 percent of the cigarette market? There's also a smoker-friendly atmosphere in Egypt, where the government owns the country's biggest cigarette company. A reporter who was covering Israel's Knesset (parliament) when it passed a law banning smoking in elevators, among other public places, recalls riding an elevator with the minister of police, Haim Bar-Lev, holding a lighted cigar. ``How can you smoke in the elevator?'' the reporter asked. ``Shouldn't you be setting an example of compliance with the new law?'' Haim Bar-Lev smiled and replied: ``The law says I mustn't smoke in the elevator. It doesn't say I mustn't hold my cigar in the elevator.'' He later died of cancer while ambassador in Moscow. A newswoman in a small restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was sitting beneath a ``No Fumar'' sign. She asked the waiter if there was someplace else she could smoke. ``The waiter promptly lifted the sign off the wall and urged me to go ahead and smoke,'' she says. ``There weren't any other customers, so I did.'' In Montreal, once a smokers' haven, there's a move afoot to restrict smoking in restaurants and most public places. That bothers Frank Valente, a restaurateur who fears business will suffer. ``The nonsmoker will have a coffee,'' he says, ``The smoker will have three cognacs and two coffees, then he'll have a bottle of wine with dinner.'' For the benefit of smokers _ and nonsmokers _ who travel, we asked AP correspondents around the globe to summarize the smoking laws where they are stationed. This is their report, with the countries in alphabetical order: AUSTRALIA: Even pubs are succumbing to creeping anti-smoke sentiment, with bar workers' unions in Sydney suggesting that employers should be legally liable if workers end up with lung disease. Smoking is outlawed in most public places and offices, and the heaps of butts at back doors and loading docks indicate compliance. BELGIUM: Enter a restaurant in Brussels and one question you will never hear is: ``Smoking or nonsmoking?'' Belgian law bans or curbs smoking in public places, but enforcement is sloppy, violations rampant. Belgians are simply not bothered by anti-smoking rules, and complaints from nonsmokers are often treated with disdain. BRAZIL: A recent ban on smoking in public buildings and on short flights is widely ignored. Smokers routinely light up in shopping malls and waiting rooms, and the ``No Smoking'' section in planes often exists only in theory. Cigarette ads on TV must carry a health warning, but often it's no more than ``Avoid smoking around small children.'' Brazil is a major producer and exporter of tobacco. CANADA: Toronto tried to become Canada's first city to ban smoking in bars and restaurants but backed down last year in the face of widespread defiance. In smoker-friendly Montreal, provincial legislation in the works would outlaw smoking in most public places and require restaurants to allocate at least 60 percent of their seats to nonsmokers. CHINA: With 320 million smokers, smoking is the closest thing China has to a national pastime. Lighting up in the Forbidden City, on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored. DENMARK: Although smoking is banned in hospitals, public transportation and shops, Danes can still have a puff in Copenhagen cafes and restaurants so long as they don't bother others. Most offices have a smoking room and, if colleagues don't mind, smokers can light up at their desks. EGYPT: Smokers puff away almost anywhere: on buses, in elevators, next to ``No Smoking'' signs. The government regularly announces anti-smoking drives, but it owns the biggest cigarette company, too. Its newest brand, Toshka, is named for a vast government plan to turn Egypt's desert into farmland _ perhaps for growing tobacco? FRANCE: Smoke-filled cafes are still pretty much the norm. But thanks to a 1991 law, the haze is starting to clear. Smoking is prohibited in subways, trains, airplanes, hospitals and public places. Though some still light up in those places, it's happening less and less. Officials at the National Committee Against Smoking say the biggest headache remains the workplace, where it's up to the boss to enforce the law. &UR; MORE
