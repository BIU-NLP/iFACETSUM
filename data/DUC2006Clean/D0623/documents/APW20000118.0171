TORONTO (AP) -- Photos of diseased organs would cover up to 50 percent of cigarette packaging under a proposal expected to be announced on Canada's national anti-smoking day, ``Weedless Wednesday.'' 

 Health Minister Alan Rock has been studying the matter for more than a year, and persistent news reports said he would formally propose the new warning regulations on Wednesday. A ministry spokesman refused to comment on the proposal. 

 If approved by the government after public hearings and other steps in the regulatory process, the warnings would be the first anywhere to include graphic photos of diseased organs, according to Cynthia Callard of Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada. 

 ``Showing a picture of a brain that's been destroyed is a much stronger way of getting the message across,'' she said. 

 Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years. Smoking is generally prohibited in public places such as government buildings and auditoriums, and some areas ban smoking in bars and restaurants. 

 Health warnings on cigarettes were required until the Supreme Court in 1995 struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional. 

 Cigarette makers continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new Tobacco Act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations on health warnings. 

 The tobacco industry has challenged other aspects of the 1997 Tobacco Act in court, contending it amounts to a ban on cigarette advertising and therefore infringes on free expression guaranteed by the Charter of Rights. The case is pending. 

 Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturer's Council, was quoted by The Globe and Mail newspaper as saying that the industry has been left out of consultations on the government's health warning plans. 

 He questioned whether the graphic images under consideration could be reproduced on packages, and said the industry previously agreed with the government that cigarette packages should have warnings but disagreed over what the warnings should say and how large they should be. 

 In the United States, cigarette makers are required to include warning labels on packages. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, intend to propose legislation this year that would require the warnings to be worded more clearly and directly, and to include a list of all ingredients and cancer-causing agents in cigarettes, Lautenberg's office said Wednesday.
