TIANJIN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the majority of Tianjin residents have hailed the "No-Smoking" regulation that goes into effect in public places this autumn. 

 The survey, conducted by the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, revealed that 95.7 percent of the respondents were in favor of the ban. The supporters include 93.1 percent male and 98.5 percent female of those polled. 

 Nearly 92 percent of the people who smoke also expressed their support for the anti-smoke movement. 

 "I have smoked for a long time, and it does great harm to my health. I hope young people will abstain from smoking," said a 59-year-old housewife. 

 According to the survey, nearly 47 percent of the citizens over age 15 are smokers, as against the country's average rate of 33.8 percent. 

 The figures showed that smokers account for 21.7-23.6 percent of local high school students, 16.7-18.6 percent of secondary school students, and even 2.01-9.8 percent of primary school pupils. 

 Each smoker in the city spends an average of 58 yuan on cigarettes, which amounts to 17 percent of their monthly expenditure. 

 The regulation on anti-smoking in public, which has been passed by the standing committee of the local People's Congress, will go into effect on October 15. 

 About 81.5 percent of the people polled believe the new regulation will help smokers kick the habit; 91.2 percent believe that it will help primary and secondary students stop smoking. 

 Many smokers have given up their long-term habit since the current anti-smoking regulations went into effect in Beijing and Shanghai, where many cigarette stalls reported low sales.
