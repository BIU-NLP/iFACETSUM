 MACAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new law on the restriction of smoking, which extends non-smoking areas and limits advertisement of cigarettes, has been passed by the Macao legislative Assembly and will become effective from January 1, 1997. 

 The new law has extended the non-smoking area to all places for health care, whether public or private, including clinics, chemist's shops and ambulance, places for people of under 16 years old, places producing or marketing inflammables, libraries, museums, public meeting halls, reading rooms, exhibition halls and within taxicabs. 

 In addition, it rules that smoking is also banned in all passenger transportation vehicles, like buses and ships, and places for public reception. 

 Violators of the rules will be fined between 250 Patacas (about 31.6 US dollars) and 10,000 Patacas (about 1,265.8 US dollars). Fines will double if the violator is found to have violated the rules for a second time within three months. 

 Meanwhile, the law also imposes more strict restrictions over the advertisement of cigarettes. 

 The number of smokers in Macao has been rising over recent years, and people have called for a more effective restriction on smoking.
