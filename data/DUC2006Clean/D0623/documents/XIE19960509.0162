BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing legislators have passed a smoking ban, stepping to the forefront of keeping tobacco out of offices. 

 The ban is scheduled to take effect next Wednesday in public places such as hospitals, schools, cinemas, department stores, and public conveyances. 

 More than 30 "no-smoking" signs have been placed inside buildings of the Municipal People's Congress, the local legislative body, since it passed the ban last December. 

 Cigarettes were banned from all offices and meeting rooms of the MPC as soon as it published news of the regulation. 

 Buildings of the municipal government and the Municipal Communist Party Committee have also become smoke-free areas, meaning that smokers are allowed to satisfy their craving only in designated smoking areas. 

 The city has asked all government office workers to set an example in the citywide anti-smoking drive, which is expected to be a long and trying time for millions of smokers. 

 More than 80,000 volunteers will be on duty in no-smoking areas from next week to levy a ten-yuan (a little more than one US dollar) fine on those who break the rules.
