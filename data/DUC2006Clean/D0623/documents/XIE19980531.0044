BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 79 provinces and cities in China have formulated regulations banning smoking in public places, a senior Chinese health official announced today. 

 Zhang Wenkang, minister of Health, made the announcement in a written speech marking the 11th "World No Tobacco Day", which falls on today. 

 Zhang said that provinces and cities which have formulated smoking-ban regulations include the provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, Shandong, Jiangxi and Fujian, the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, and 70 provincial capitals such as Guangzhou and Wuhan, as well as medium- and small-sized cities. 

 China has about 320 million smokers. A survey shows that over 90 percent of smokers smoke in public places. 

 Since smoking in a public place causes serious secondary smoking and has a bad impact on youngsters, China has taken the ban on smoking in public places as a key part of the ban on smoking in public places in its anti-smoking effort. 

 A regulation banning smoking in public transport means and waiting areas was enacted in last May. 

 However, these "smoking-control" cities only account for one-eighth of all the country's cities, according to an official with the National Committee for Patriotic Health campaign (NCPHC), who described it as a "long-term and arduous" task to promote work in this regard in all cities. 

 Lu Ming with the NCPHC said that the rapid development of the country's tobacco industry in recent years has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of smokers. 

 A survey shows that the ratio of adolescent and youth smokers in the age group of 15-25 increased by six percentage points in 1996 over 1984, and the average age for smoking the first cigarette moved to 19.7 from 22.4. 

 However, Lu pointed out, China's efforts to control smoking is gaining increasing support from both smokers and non-smokers. 

 According to a survey, 84 percent of the smokers and 89 percent of the non-smokers have become aware of the hazard caused by smoking to health. Meanwhile, 74 percent of the correspondents support government's effort to ban smoking in public places. 

 The Beijing Municipal Committee for Patriotic Health Campaign awarded today a group of "smoking-free" schools and a group of educators who have done a good job in promoting smoking-control efforts. 

 Activities to publicize the knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health and keeping youngsters away from cigarettes were also conducted in busy commercial districts in the Chinese capital today.
