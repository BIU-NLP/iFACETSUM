WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing prosperity, affordable housing for many of the working poor has become harder to find, a federal report said Monday. 

 The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991. 

 The government regards housing for low-income people affordable if does not consume more than a third of a family's income. 

 ``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his department's headquarters. 

 Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down.'' 

 Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself. 

 In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher program known as Section 8. But because of the nation's rising prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the subsidies. 

 Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went out of the housing business.'' He blamed the Republicans in Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress said zero.'' 

 When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved by Congress in the four-year period, but he said that there were good reasons for that . 

 A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one, take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them. 

 The Republicans' complaints were satisfied, Lazio said, and Congress approved 50,000 new housing vouchers in 1999 and 60,000 more last year. 

 As to Clinton's request for 120,000 more this year, Lazio said, ``I support the additional use of vouchers, but it is incumbent on us to be responsible in paying for them.'' 

 Lazio said he had introduced a measure calling for 100,000 units, ``so we are very close.'' He said that the Clinton administration had to show where the money would come from and not resort to budget ``gimmicks'' to pay for it. 

 Cuomo said that the additional 120,000 housing vouchers, which would cost $6 billion, would help ease the ``cruel irony'' of the strong economy hurting the poor by driving up rents. ``Many people are being left behind and they need help,'' he said. 

 When asked if his own department, which has jurisdiction over housing, should not share in the blame for the shortage, Cuomo said, ``If there was any failure, it was our failure to persuade Congress to provide funds.''
