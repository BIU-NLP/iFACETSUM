BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, courting inner-city voters, called Tuesday for a $1.7 billion program offering tax incentives to developers to build homes for low-income people. 

 Bush's proposal, the latest in a series aimed at bolstering affordable housing, includes a five-year program giving developers a tax credit worth up to 10 percent a year on the cost of building in low-income areas. 

 Bush, speaking of the working poor on the lawn of a rebuilt home, said, ''The purpose of the program is not just to provide shelter, but shelter that somebody can say 'this is mine.' When you own a home, it not only enhances the community, it makes the schools better because you have a certain sense of stability.'' 

 The Texas governor won his party's presidential nomination by energizing core Republican voters, but since then he has worked to moderate his image and court voters not traditionally attracted to the GOP. 

 Aides to rival Al Gore dismissed the new proposal, arguing it was yet another example of Bush promising something he hasn't delivered as governor of Texas. 

 ''He keeps making promises he can't pay for'' because of Bush's $483 billion tax-cut proposal, said spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''This is yet another issue where Bush has done nothing in Texas but expects us to believe he would do as president.'' 

 Documents furnished by Bush's campaign said competition among developers for the credits probably would drive the value lower than the total of 50 percent over five years. Up to 15,000 homes a year could be developed because of the incentives, the campaign estimated. 

 Bush offered his proposal at the home of Oberrion Gibson, a 67-year-old worker at a foster care center for the mentally retarded. 

 Ms. Gibson lived in the neighborhood for 34 years before her home was razed in September and replaced with a new home. Construction was made possible by a 4.5 percent loan from a nonprofit neighborhood development group. 

 ''I didn't want to leave the neighborhood,'' Ms. Gibson said. 

 Bush sat at the kitchen table with Ms. Gibson, daughter Carolyn and granddaughter Whitney, before speaking to a small crowd gathered on the front lawn. 

 ''This is a fabulous house,'' Bush said, holding hands and praying with Ms. Gibson's family. 

 Previously, Bush has called for programs in which the federal government would match the down payment of a low-income resident seeking to buy a home, and to allow rent assistance money to be used to purchase a home. 

 In total, Bush would spend $3.7 billion over five years on affordable housing programs, aides said. 

 His campaign said home ownership rates for low-income individuals and families are barely 50 percent, well below the 67 percent rate for all Americans. In addition, government studies have found up to 2.2 million families live in housing with ''moderate to severe physical problems.'' 

 Bush argued there is a barrier to refurbishing those homes because of a gap between the investment needed and the low market prices for inner-city homes. The tax credit is a way to bridge that gap, he said. 

 After offering his proposal in Battle Creek, Bush headed for a senior citizen center in Dearborn, pushing for elderly housing efforts. 

 During this year's primary elections, former rival John McCain handed Bush a resounding defeat in Michigan, largely by luring record numbers of independent voters to the polls. 

 The November election could turn on the outcomes in such big industrial states as Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. Both Bush and rival Gore are likely to devote significant campaign time and resources to those states.
