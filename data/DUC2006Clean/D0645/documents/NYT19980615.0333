WASHINGTON _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income households has steadily increased over the last two decades while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of national housing needs released Monday. 

 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 or less per year, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4 million in 1995, the latest year for which data was available. 

 The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children, and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such duress, said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 

 About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995, when the Republican Party took control of Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget. 

 The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain if Congress will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating the request has granted approval of 8,000 such vouchers, but the House has yet to consider the request. 

 ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than $6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study. ``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a distance at the economic prosperity benefiting most Americans.'' 

 Rep. Rick A. Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity, said the center's study tells the public what it already knows: there is a growing shortage of affordable housing for the poorest Americans. 

 But Lazio cautioned that ``more funding for bad programs is not the solution.'' He noted that the federal government has more than doubled spending on programs to aid the homeless population, but it has had little impact. ``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt Gingrich's point person on housing issues. 

 Despite the call for more affordable housing units from the administration and advocates for fair housing, some people think the federal government should not be in the business of housing to begin with. 

 ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington research group. ``I would get the federal government out of the housing business. It has no constitutional authority to provide federal housing.'' 

 Low-income housing is a local issue that should be placed in the hands of the private sector, said Hudgins. He said much of the shortage of affordable housing is a direct result of the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, in which the federal government razed neighborhoods and erected ``vertical ghettos'' in their place. 

 Not so, say academics and housing advocates. They say the federal government has an obligation to step in. 

 ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare, a housing policy analyst. ``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such prosperous economic times.''

 Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found: 

 _ Eight out of 10 renters below the federal poverty line face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the federal standard established in 1981 under President Reagan. 

 _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of their income on rent and utilities in 1995. 

 _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities. 

 _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. In the West, there are closer to three low-income renters for each unit. 

 The study is ``kind of a slam dunk'' in showing the need for affordable housing, said Michael A. Stegman, director of the Center for Community Capitalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a leading expert on housing trends. 

 ``If you believe that people ought not spend more than 50 percent for a roof over their head, you can use the term crisis without saying the 'sky is falling.' We are at a crisis stage,'' Stegman said.
