WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development is taking steps to preserve thousands of federally subsidized housing units for the poor. 

 Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Thursday the department will begin increasing payments to landlords who participate in the program. 

 Many of the payments, set years ago, are below current market levels, and increasing them may entice landlords to stay in the program, he said. 

 The increased payments will cost $30 million this fiscal year, HUD said. 

 The department also will continue working with Congress to draft a long-term, comprehensive solution to the problem, Cuomo said. 

 ``This is an important reform that will help protect families who need and deserve decent housing, at a fair cost to the American taxpayer,'' he said. 

 Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay about 30 percent of their income as rent. In return, the government pays the difference between what the tenant pays and what the apartment would cost on the open market. 

 Landlords or HUD can end the arrangement when the contracts expire. Most landlords continue in the program, Cuomo said, but problems arise when landlords leave. The poor must either pay the higher rents or find new housing. 

 In the next five years, two-thirds of all such contracts will expire, affecting nearly 14,000 properties with 1 million subsidized units, Cuomo said. 

 More than 17,000 subsidized units at more than 300 properties left the program last year, according to a report on the issue released Thursday by HUD. 

 Known as ``project-based'' Section 8 because the subsidies are tied to specific rental units, the program now serves about 1.4 million families nationwide. 

 Another form of the housing subsidy is known as ``tenant-based'' Section 8. Renters receive vouchers they can take with them from unit to unit in search of housing. This portion of the program now serves about 1.5 million families. 

 Several bills to address the problem are pending in Congress.
