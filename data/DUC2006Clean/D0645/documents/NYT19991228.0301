WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he will send to Congress in February, administration officials said Tuesday. It would amount to the largest expansion of the housing program in a decade. 

 The vouchers allow low-income families to find their own housing, and to use government subsidies to help pay the costs. Congressional Republicans have been reluctant to finance the program at the levels requested by the president in recent years, resulting in a large backlog in applicants. After Clinton proposed money for 100,000 vouchers this year, Congress eventually approved 60,000. 

 Currently, 1.4 million families receive such housing vouchers. But a report prepared by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in March 1999 found that the number of families waiting for such assistance had increased to 600,000. The wait for vouchers has stretched to 10 years in Newark and Los Angeles, seven years in Houston and five years in Chicago and Memphis, the report found. 

 Aides said the president's proposed expansion, which will cost $690 million, is designed to address a paradox of the current economic expansion. At the same time that the strong national economy is making many Americans rich, it is hurting millions of the nation's poorest people by making affordable housing more difficult to find. 

 ``We have the greatest need for affordable housing in history,'' Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday in an interview. ``The strong economy is driving up rents. This is the most aggressive housing budget of his administration. It is the largest request of the decade.'' 

 White House aides said Clinton would include in his budget a package of vouchers intended for individuals who are moving from welfare to work, homeless people, those with large families and working-class families designated by local housing authorities. All recipients would have to meet strict income requirements, about $27,900 per family nationally. 

 ``We see this as an important part of the overall strategy of supporting working families,'' an aide to Clinton said. 

 The president will deliver the broad outlines of his budget on Jan. 27 at his final State of the Union address. On Feb. 7, he will send the document to the Congress. 

 Housing experts say the voucher program has grown steadily from 1978 until 1995, when congressional Republicans stopped further expansions because of concerns about the management of the money. Since then, there have been only two moderate increases. 

 One key Republican lawmaker said the key question is how Clinton intends to finance the new vouchers. 

 ``I strongly support additional vouchers, provided that the president can find an acceptable way to pay for them,'' said Rep. Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, chairman of the House housing subcommittee. 

 The vouchers continue to be sought-after commodities that can take years to obtain. The average subsidy, aides said, is about $400 a month. The tenant kicks in $223 a month, to cover an average rent of $623. 

 ``Many low-income families don't live near where their jobs are and this program allows them to move closer,'' a White House official said. ``Housing is expensive and it's hard to find. This program allows them to fill in the gap.''
