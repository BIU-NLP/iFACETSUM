WASHINGTON _ A study of American cities by the Clinton administration says the strong national economy has left most of them in their best financial shape in decades. 

 But the report, ``The State of the Cities 1998,'' also finds that the nation's urban centers are still suffering from chronic problems afflicting the poor _ unemployment, inadequate housing and substandard education _ that could grow worse over the next five years as hundreds of thousands of city residents move off welfare. 

 To help the welfare recipients as well as the low-income wage earners they will be competing with for employment, the administration has asked Congress to approve an array of new and expanded programs as part of the 1999 fiscal year budget for what the White House calls ``the most wide-ranging budget for cities in more than a decade.'' 

 The largest part of the request comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is seeking $1.8 billion in new spending beyond the appropriation of $24 billion it has received in each of the last five years. 

 ``The success of the Clinton economy has meant real progress for America's cities,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development. ``The president's urban agenda is helping cities to continue to recover from years of decline and making them better places to live and work. This is a mid-term report card with an A grade for cities, but there is still homework to be done.'' 

 While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100 billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get additional money for new programs. Among other reasons, Republicans in both houses are eager to use some of the surplus to cut taxes. 

 One congressional aide familiar with the housing budget negotiations that are now under way predicted that Congress would likely authorize new spending for core programs, like additional vouchers to allow inner-city residents to live closer to jobs or transportation lines. But money for new ``bells and whistles'' programs, he added, will be harder to come by. 

 The report, which is to be presented by Cuomo this weekend at the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual convention in Reno, Nev., provides ample evidence that the country's economic growth in recent years has dramatically improved conditions in cities of all size around the country. 

 Among the major findings are a 10.4 percent increase in employment in cities over the last five years, and a 34 percent increase in new low-skilled jobs from 1994 to 1995, compared with a 13 percent increase from 1991 to 1994. 

 But those gains pale beside job growth in suburban areas, the report says, a disparity that triggers a domino effect of adverse consequences for cities. As urban problems like crime and poor schools steadily persuade many middle-class residents to leave for the suburbs, commercial investment follows, draining cities of their job base and tax base. 

 The report contends that the people who are hurt most are the lowest-wage earners, who have fewer job opportunities and, often, no practical means of transportation to reach jobs in the suburbs. The report contends that over the next five years, their ranks will increase by 353,000 as current welfare recipients join the search for work. 

 Citing a recent study of 74 urban areas by the conference of mayors, the administration's report says that employers are likely to find at least two applicants for the same low-paying job over the next five years, and some cities, like Cleveland; Newark, N.J., and Providence, R.I., are projecting 10 or more more. 

 The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs. 

 ``The economy is not working at the low end,'' said William Apgar, a senior housing department official who wrote the report. ''For those people, we need to have an extra push. The good news is that cities are clearly doing better, but the hard-core issues are not going away.'' 

 These are among the most ambitious of the programs proposed by the Administration and their projected costs: 

 _ The housing department is seeking $400 million for a new Community Empowerment Fund, which would be used to leverage $2 billion in private-sector loans to create 280,000 jobs. 

 _ The department is also requesting $283 milion in new low-income housing vouchers to make it easier for 50,000 welfare recipients to find a job. 

 _ The Department of Education wants $1.5 billion over five years to create Education Opportunity Zones in high poverty areas and $7.3 billion over the same period to hire new teachers to reduce the class size in grades 1 through 3.
