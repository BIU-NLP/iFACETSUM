WASHINGTON _ Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo announced a boost in subsidies for low-income renters in 39 metropolitan areas Tuesday. 

 The boost, which takes effect next month, is part of a $100 million-a-year plan to increase the share of rental housing available for federal subsidies from 40 percent to 50 percent. 

 Cuomo said the booming economy is creating a ``housing crisis'' leaving 5.4 million low-income families paying more than half of their income for housing. Rental rates have risen at one and a half times the rate of inflation in the past three years, according to HUD's State of the Cities 2000 report. 

 ``It is somewhat counter-intuitive, but it is the successful economy that is actually creating this problem for us,'' Cuomo said. ``We have more people in need of affordable housing than ever before.'' 

 The federal assistance vouchers allow most recipients to pay no more than 30 percent of their income towards their rent, with the government providing the rest, according to the department. 

 The new policy, which Cuomo said can be initiated using money currently available, would add 1.4 million additional units nationwide. 

 However, any housing agency nationwide that can demonstrate difficulties obtaining rental units through vouchers could be eligible for the increased subsidies. 

 In addition, the department's proposed budget for fiscal 2001, which is scheduled to be reviewed by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday, calls for 120,000 new vouchers and a new $50 million Housing Voucher Success Fund to help families search for available housing. 

 ``What promise can we make today that is better than a place to house your family?'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a member of the Appropriations Committee. ``We'll do whatever we can to see the funds are there.'' 

 The voucher expansion comes almost simultaneously with the announcement Monday of a new program devised by HUD through which rental assistance vouchers can be used to purchase homes. 

 The program, effective in October, allows first-time home buyers with household incomes of at least $10,300 who are eligible for the current rental assistance voucher program, to use the same amount provided in rental vouchers towards payment of a home mortgage.
