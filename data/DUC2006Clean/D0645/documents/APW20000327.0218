CHICAGO (AP) -- With the bank foreclosing on her landlord's building, Magdalena Mendez needs to find an apartment for herself and her five children -- fast. But the Chicago salon assistant is having a hard time finding what she wants: a three-bedroom for less than $800 a month in the same neighborhood as her children's schools. 

 She's not alone. A federal report released Monday shows that a record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million -- were paying more than half their income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997, the freshest figures available. That's an increase of 12 percent since 1991. 

 The report is being presented to Congress, which is considering a bill that includes $690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide. 

 ''Everything is going so well (economically), it's hard to imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage,'' Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday. ''But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable housing.'' 

 Housing and Urban Development officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest Americans. That, in turn, is driving up rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa. 

 ''They want the city back,'' Mendez said of suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabilitated homes just blocks from the three-unit building she must leave Tuesday. 

 ''It's upsetting to those of us who've always worked and lived here in the city -- who have an education, who work hard and who still can't get what we want,'' said Mendez, a 34-year-old Chicago native who paid $350 a month for her top-floor apartment in that building. She figures it could now rent for $1,000 a month if it's rehabbed, and that's more than she makes in a month. 

 It's not that gentrification is a new concept. But statistics show that it is an accelerating one. 

 Consider San Francisco's Mission District, a working-class, predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning upscale. In New York, old tenement buildings on Manhattan's Lower East Side are being converted into luxury units. 

 Federal researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units between 1993 and 1997, compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993. Officials at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some neighborhoods are trying to buck. 

 ''Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of America, and we'd like to keep it that way,'' said Fran Tobin, a community activist who's fighting to save affordable housing on Chicago's far North Side.
