BOSTON -- They have wish lists. 

 Housing activist Bruce Marks wants Fleet Financial Group to sell some of the branches it will be required to divest to a national lender, which will keep the hometown bank competitive. 

 ``It's our basic feeling that this is like a couple of feudal lords getting together,'' Marks, executive director of the Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, quipped. 

 The Rev. Joseph E. Washington, chairman of the Boston-based Organization for a New Equality, wants Fleet to increase its lending to minority small businesses. 

 Marc Draisen, who heads a statewide group for community development corporations, wants Fleet to convert into equity part of the estimated $200 million in loans it will have to pledge, as part of the merger, to a low-income housing program. 

 Welcome to the merger mating game: Where housing and community activists are handed leverage the likes of which they rarely see. 

 Banks like Fleet, mindful that staunch community opposition has the potential to delay their deals and create regulatory headaches, take these demands seriously. 

 ``If this was a merger in the insurance world, or of phone companies, they would not be talking to community groups,'' said Thomas Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, a nonprofit group whose low-income home loan program is underwritten by nine area banks. 

 Under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, banks are required to make sure they loan money to residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods in which they do business. Each year banks receive a rating from federal regulators for their CRA performance; most, including Fleet and BankBoston, receive high marks. But when regulators start reviewing the fine print of a merger application, community support or opposition takes on added significance. And getting local groups onboard early can influence regulators' decisions of whether or not to dispense with public hearings on the matter. 

 Fleet knows well the sting of bad local publicity. 

 In the early 1990s, a former Fleet subsidiary was accused of engaging in unscrupulous lending practices in poor and minority communities. After a 4 1/2-year battle with Marks, and a multimillion-dollar settlement, Fleet agreed to earmark more than $7.6 billion over three years to low-income customers and affordable housing initiatives nationally. The agreements were inked shortly before Fleet's merger with Shawmut National Corp. Indeed, a major beneficiary of Fleet's new initiative, dubbed ``InCity,'' was a burgeoning affordable housing program run by Marks. 

 Despite that largesse, housing activists worry that one less major bank in Boston will reduce the overall amount of CRA spending locally. Fleet and BankBoston together have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to comply with the CRA to gain community support. Fleet spent $151.5 million in Massachusetts on specially-targeted CRA mortgage programs last year, while BankBoston spent about $100 million. 

 The most recent round of dealmaking has only begun. 

 In exchange for an attractive set of ``commitments,'' Draisen said, local groups might offer Fleet their neutrality before regulators. ``We will be holding meetings across the state with CDCs and other allies to try and come up with a list of critical requests,'' Draisen said.
