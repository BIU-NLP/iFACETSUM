WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wanted: Working families earning decent wages. 

 Position: To be public housing tenants. 

 Responsibilities: Pay higher-than-average rents and serve as role models to unemployed neighbors. 

 Congress last fall passed reforms intended to discourage the use of public housing projects as warehouses for the very poor. 

 U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said local housing authorities should create ``functioning societies'' by mixing higher-income working poor with those who have very low wages or no income apart from welfare. 

 The new regulations, which will be phased in over the next few years, have some local housing authority directors scratching their heads, wondering how to attract people with higher incomes to projects that most consider a last resort. 

 ``Unless we have lovely and gracious units to rent, I'm not sure how it's going to all come together,'' West Palm Beach Housing Authority Executive Director Laurel Robinson said. 

 Several of her counterparts in Palm Beach County's other housing authorities worry they eventually may have to turn away single moms with no place to go _ the staple of many housing projects _ in favor of working families with higher incomes. 

 ``You're talking about taking away the roof over someone's head,'' Palm Beach County Housing Authority Director of Operations Beth Kincey said. 

 The new law encourages housing authorities to jump higher-earning families ahead of lower-income families on apartment waiting lists. 

 In Palm Beach County, that means attracting tenants earning as much as $40,950 a year for a family of four, according to HUD guidelines. 

 The national average for public housing tenants is $7,000 to $8,000, according to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. 

 A critic of the law, the Oakland, Calif.-based National Housing Law Project, says one of the legislation's intents is to decrease federal subsidies for housing authorities. 

 Families pay 30 percent of their incomes for rent; HUD covers the difference between what tenants pay and the cost of maintaining the apartments. 

 The law requires housing authorities to develop strategies to improve the blend of incomes in their projects, said HUD spokesman Stan Vosper. The federal agency has yet to set a recommended ratio of higher-to-lower incomes. 

 Housing authorities will be graded yearly on their efforts to alter the mix in their projects, Vosper said. But the law contains no clear penalty for agencies that fail to do so. 

 Complying with the law should be easy, Vosper said. Housing officials need only look at their waiting lists and pick the higher-income people, he said. 

 But most housing authority directors say they are hard-pressed to find anyone making even 50 percent of the county's median income on their waiting lists. 

 In most cases, a family can earn up to 80 percent of median income and still qualify for public housing. That's up to $32,750 for a family of two in Palm Beach County _ which would have to pay $807 a month in rent. 

 ``If they come in and I say you're going to pay $807 a month, they're going to look at me like I'm some kind of idiot,'' said Carla Lewis, an eligibility specialist for the West Palm Beach Housing Authority. ``That's too much to live in a project.'' 

 Letiza Dexter, 24, who lives with her two children in Delray Beach's Carver Estates, pays $379 per month _ one of the higher rents at the complex. 

 Her annual income is $15,480 including child support, which is only 34 percent of median income for a family of three. 

 ``If they let all the high income people come in, what are they going to do with the low income people?'' she said. ``They're going to put us in the dog house.'' 

 One way to attract higher-income tenants is to improve the quality of the apartments, some authority directors say. 

 Another idea is ceiling rents, where tenants pay the market value of the apartment rather than 30 percent of their income. If their income increases, they can save that money, instead of spending it on rent. 

 That's what Boca Raton Housing Authority has done for seven years, said Sandra McGinn, its executive director. 

 The housing authority charges a maximum of $475 for a three bedroom apartment without air conditioning in its 95-unit Dixie Manor, she said. 

 ``We do have some long-term families who choose to stay there who are making $20,000 to $25,000 a year,'' McGinn said. 

 But high-rent Boca Raton is the exception to many rules. 

 The Boca Raton Housing Authority has long attracted the cream of the working poor and collects rents double that collected by other housing authorities because it has favored higher earners for years. 

 That's a practice HUD officials formally complained about last year, saying the housing authority may be unfairly restricting access to families on welfare _ a charge McGinn says is not true. Her agency and HUD are working to resolve the issue, she said. 

 The new law will actually force Boca Raton Housing Authority to troll for the poorest of the poor to fill their apartments. 

 That's because the law contains something of a safety net for the lowest-earners. 

 It requires that at least 40 percent of a housing authority's newly available units go to families earning less than 30 percent of a region's median income. In Palm Beach County, that's $15,357 a year or less for a family of four. 

 Most housing authority directors say they'd prefer to achieve mixed incomes by encouraging those who already live in public housing to earn more, as Dexter did. 

 She was unemployed and on welfare when she moved to Carver Estates with her two children five years ago. 

 She became a housekeeper at Abbey Delray South, left the welfare rolls and started to receive child support for her five-year-old son two years ago. Consequently, her rent more than doubled. 

 ``The ones who are trying to help themselves _ they should try to help them out,'' she said.
