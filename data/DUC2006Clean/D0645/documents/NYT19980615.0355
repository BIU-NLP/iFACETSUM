Washington _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income households has steadily increased over the last two decades as the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of national housing needs released Monday. 

 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin in 1995, the latest year for which data was available. 

 The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 

 About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget. 

 The Clinton Administration has requested 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget. But it is far from certain if Congress will approve such a measure. A Senate panel evaluating the request has granted approval of a 8,000 such vouchers, but the House has yet to consider the request. 

 ``Unfortunately, there are a lot more $6-an-hour jobs than $6-an-hour apartments,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in a statement responding to the study. ``Too many poor families are only spectators looking from a distance at the economic prosperity benefitting most Americans.'' 

 But critics of the rental voucher program say the federal government should not be in the housing business. 

 ``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington D.C. think tank. ``I would get the federal government out of the housing business. It has no consitutional authority to provide federal housing.'' 

 Rep. Rick A. Lazio, (R-NY.), the chairman of the House subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, cautioned that ``more funding for bad programs is not the solution.'' He noted that the federal government has more than doubled spending on programs to aid the homeless, but it has had little impact. ``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt Gingrich's point person on housing issues. 

 Housing advocates say the situation is dire. 

 ``The income distribution between rich and poor is getting wider and wider,'' said Cushing N. Dolbeare a housing policy analyst. ``It's a creeping crisis. It's ironic because we are in such prosperous economic times.'' 

 Using data compiled by the American Housing Survey, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found the following: 

 _ Eight out of every 10 renters below the federal poverty line face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the level of affordability for federal housing established in 1981 under President Reagan's Administration. 

 _ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of their income on rent and utilities in 1995. 

 _ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities. 

 _ By 1995, there were nearly two low-income renters for every low-cost unit. In the West there are closer to three low-income renters for each unit.
