BEIDAIHE (Hebei), March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance its international cooperation in protecting and reasonably utilizing the country's wetlands, said a Chinese official, who is attending an international symposium on wetlands and water birds protection. 

 China will cooperate with the International Wetlands Organization to evaluate, monitor, and manage the country's wetlands and make relevant policies, the official said. 

 He said that the symposium, which followed the establishment of China's office of the International Wetlands Organization, shows that the Chinese government is making further progress in protecting wetlands. 

 The office, set up in Beijing, will help China to make contact with other countries and organizations, work out the plan for wetlands protection and apply for international aid, said Chen Kelin, who heads the office. 

 Wetlands are a kind of ecosystem, including lakes and marshlands, with ecological and economic functions such as storing floodwater for use against drought. 

 China now has 63 million hectares of various kinds of wetlands, or 6.6 percent of the national total area and ranking first in Asia, among which some have been listed as "Wetlands of International Importance." 

 The symposium, which is held in Beidaihe, a sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry, the Japan's Environmental Agency and the Asia-Pacific Branch of the Wetlands International.
