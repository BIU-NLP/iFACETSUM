WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas. 

 The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements, according to government and private sources. 

 The Corps scheduled a news conference on the regulations for Monday. But sources familiar with the regulations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today final release may be delayed because of some technical changes. 

 The new regulations have been in the works for more than four years, but were given new impetus 18 months ago when President Clinton said he wanted to tighten the requirements on developers ''to ensure that we think twice before building in our most sensitive wetlands.'' 

 According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to three acres under current regulations. 

 The restriction was reduced from 10 acres in December 1996. 

 The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction. 

 Statistics on wetlands loss vary widely. Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system. 

 Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction under the nationwide permit system. 

 The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all wetlands. 

 Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection. 

 The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and 1996. 

 'The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years. 

 Meanwhile, homebuilders and the National Association of Counties have accused the Corps of overreaction. 

 There is ''little evidence to justify'' the abandonment of the nationwide permit system, and the tighter half-acre restriction is not needed, said the National Association of Home Builders. 

 ''In 1998 alone, Corps statistics show that under the (nationwide) permit program landowners provided 6,304 acres in mitigation in exchange for permission to fill or otherwise impact 2,974 acres.'' said Neil Gaffney, NAHB spokesman. 

 The Corps' completion of the new rules was first reported in today's Washington Post.
