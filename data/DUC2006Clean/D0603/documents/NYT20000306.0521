The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7: 

 Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the 100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food chain. They have succeeded in beating back the big threats, including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later, the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these valuable acres to private interests almost overnight. But they have been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers, which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes. 

 Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites. The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres. This change could make a big difference. Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year, many of them lost to development on small parcels. Regionally, the rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are threatened by small-scale development. 

 The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that took the Corps to court. The rules also represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit 26. Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres of wetlands. In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three acres. But even these stricter standards have allowed the disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year. 

 Several important steps remain. Developers and contractors have denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to resist legislative attempts to overturn them. 

 Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way. This will require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules. The administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs for these additional enforcement responsibilities. 

 But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to cheer. The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental stewardship, has acted responsibly.
