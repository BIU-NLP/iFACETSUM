BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Conserving China's wetlands is a national priority, said Zhen Rende, director of the wildlife and forestry department of the Ministry of Forestry. 

 Headed by the ministry, 17 ministries and commissions are formulating the systematic action program to guide the country's conservation and use of wetlands, Zhen said. 

 Speaking at the International Workshop on Wetlands which opened today in this sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, he announced that the program includes the establishment of wetlands nature reserves, protection of species, spreading of scientific findings and training of personnel. 

 Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land. 

 The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms. 

 In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971. 

 To collect the comprehensive information on China's wetlands resources, China has organized several large-scale investigations in the past few years and ran several training classes in Jiangxi, Shandong provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions for the administration of wetlands. 

 According to official statistics, China has more than 63 million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9 percent of the world's total. 

 Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the wetlands were useless mud. Now more and more people have recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent task. 

 The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe.
