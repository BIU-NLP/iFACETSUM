Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams, swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the Corps' records indicates. 

 The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2 percent of permit applications for major wetland projects. In 1992, the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according to the documents. 

 Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid time-consuming, costly enforcement actions. 

 Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7 million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55. During that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as the region's economy prospered. 

 Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so there are fewer attempts to damage them. 

 In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to 1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor issues and allowing state regulators to do more. 

 ``We believe we've substantially increased environmental protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.

 Employees critical 

 &QL; &QL; 

 But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of. 

 ``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve developments she felt should have been turned down. ``A program without enforcement is an invitation to break the law without consequences.'' 

 The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group for government employees concerned about environmental issues, provided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other documents obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the Freedom of Information Act after employees complained of a precipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps. 

 Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do not have strong enforcement programs. He said New England states generally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough Corps can help stand up to powerful industries. 

 ``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't organize it the way it is. But given where we are, we would be in real bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie said. 

 The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. Americans destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water. 

 &QL; &QL; 

 Clinton steps in 

 &QL; &QL; 

 The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating 100,000 acres more than are destroyed. The main tool would be the restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the Florida Everglades. 

 The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development. 

 The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in Boston. At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the Corps is often an obstacle to development. 

 However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly. Almost half of the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses and individuals to challenge Corps decisions. 

 Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA. The Corps, best known as the builder of public works and flood control projects, objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because of a violation. 

 Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility review. Orders to restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109 since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to 5,141 in the same period. 

 ``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps employee said. ``What's the use of getting a permit if people can do it without a permit?'' 

 A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases to avoid. According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a reported violation is substantial. Even with some major violations, the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case'' if another agency will not take over. 

 &QL; &QL; 

 Work overload 

 &QL; &QL; 

 New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by one full-time and one part-time staff member. 

 But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle prosecution of flagrant cases. 

 More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement overlooks big improvements at the Corps. For instance, he said the Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit, three times smaller than the previous minimum size. 

 He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones. Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged. 

 ``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005. Our part of that is that we believe we should continue to administer the program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said. 

 However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows half of them fail. Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage Studet cites does not include illegal activity.

 Criticism of Corps 

 &QL; &QL; 

 Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries. Even in the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to political pressure. 

 Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for the crop. The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly granted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to offset the damage. 

 New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each project received proper review before it was approved, saying critics ``are rushing to judgment. We certainly were knowledgeable that the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean we are going to roll over. We are very careful not to give special treatment.'' 

 In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up wetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate 12 positions during the last four years. ``We're doing more with less,'' he said.
