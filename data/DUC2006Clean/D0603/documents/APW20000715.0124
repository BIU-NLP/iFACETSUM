IMPERIAL, Calif. (AP) -- It is known as one of the nation's dirtiest waterways, an 80-mile drain that catches raw sewage and industrial waste from the Mexican border city of Mexicali and mixes it with agricultural runoff from the irrigated fields of the Imperial Valley. 

 But after years of hand-wringing and bad publicity, the New River is getting the kind of attention that could end its notoriety. 

 A federally financed project to create artificial wetlands that would cleanse millions of gallons of river water is nearing completion, and the U.S. and Mexican governments last month announced $50 million in financing for badly needed upgrades to the Mexicali sewage treatment system. 

 The combination could go a long way to removing much of the pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California. 

 ''Eventually, with what we're doing and what they're doing we'll clean up a lot of the problems with this river,'' said Leon Lesicka, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and chairman of a task force coordinating river cleanup projects. 

 Signs of significant improvement in the river could be less than four years away, said Eugenia McNaughton, an environmental scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency. 

 ''This is a workable problem and we are working on it,'' McNaughton said. 

 So far, the progress is visible only along the river's banks at two sites near Imperial and Brawley, about 100 miles east of San Diego, where workers are carving berms and ponds for the artificial wetlands. 

 After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will plant bull rushes and other wetland plants. They won't use New River water out of concern for the workers' health, Lesicka said. 

 For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes and throat after a few minutes of exposure. 

 Illegal immigrants float down the river to avoid the Border Patrol, knowing agents are reluctant to follow them in. Polio, tetanus and tuberculosis have all been found in the river, according to the Imperial Irrigation District, the valley's main water agency. 

 The river was formed from Colorado River flooding between 1904 and 1906. Waters breached a canal and turned a usually dry creek bed into a river that flows from about 20 miles south of Mexicali to the Salton Sea, a lake with no natural outlets that is choking on its high salinity. 

 Congress approved $3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to filter the contaminated water through a process known as bioremediation. An additional $25 million of federal funding through the North American Development Bank is the U.S. contribution to the sewer upgrade in Mexicali, a city that has grown to an estimated 1 million. 

 The Imperial Irrigation District, which also is part of the task force and is building part of the wetlands, will consider adding more wetlands sites to help filter the water, possibly expanding to the nearby Alamo River, another Salton Sea tributary, said agency spokeswoman Sue Giller. 

 In the artificial wetlands being built, water will flow into collection ponds, where silt and minerals will settle to the bottom, then pass through a series of reed-covered berms before returning to the river again. Biologists will monitor the collection ponds over three years to see how they affect wildlife. 

 There's no easy way to explain why the cleanup has taken so long, said Marie Barrett, a biologist involved with the project and a lifelong valley resident. 

 ''Once we realized we had a problem, it took us a long time to get going,'' she said. ''But now we're actually doing something and it's so exciting.''
