TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Burlington County Republican leader who used 22 acres of protected wetland in the Pinelands to expand harvesting operations may soon be off the hook. 

 Garfield DeMarco, former Burlington County GOP chairman and a generous contributor to state Republican causes, has applied for a newly created state permit that would give the expansion after-the-fact state approval. 

 DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act. 

 By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before undertaking the expansion. The state Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him of the violation. 

 Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as $10,000 per day. At that rate, the potential penalty now exceeds $8 million. 

 DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, said DEP officials have given no indication that they plan to impose anywhere near the maximum potential penalty against the cranberry grower. 

 DEP spokesman Peter Page said the department is negotiating with DeMarco over how much to assess in penalties, but he said DeMarco could have been eligible for a state permit had he sought one. 

 Not everyone is happy with DeMarco's possible settlement. 

 Critics say DeMarco is a well-connected political figure in the state. 

 DEP Commissioner Robert C. Shinn is a Burlington County native and a political protege of DeMarco's. Page said Shinn has excused himself from the case, citing appearance of a potential conflict. 

 Glenn Paulsen, chairman of the Burlington County GOP, is manager of the Trenton office of Capehart & Scatchard, the law firm representing DeMarco's application.

 State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than $200,000 last year. Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey Republicans $517,000 - including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995 and 1999. 

 ''Frankly, I think this is special-interest money and special-interest regulatory privilege,'' Bill Neil, director of the conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions. ''This is a sorry chapter in New Jersey policy history.'' 

 Drollas said DeMarco's political ties have nothing to do with the application. 

 Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years. 

 Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system. 

 Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10 acres in any year. That means DeMarco's 22-acre expansion will have to be phased in under permits issued over the next three years.
