VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- A temporary dirt logging road carved across a half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest ski area, in trouble with the government. 

 Last fall, Tom Allender, resort planning director, and his crews built the road to access an 885-acre expansion into undeveloped backcountry. 

 Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat. 

 The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation last month. The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to $27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna. 

 Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake. But the EPA's Steve Ireland rejected that defense. 

 ``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United States without a permit, it is a violation,'' he said. ``It's worse if they knew they were breaking the law, but whether it was unintentional doesn't change anything.'' 

 In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road, leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut timber and no way to remove it. It may have to be burned on site. 

 The U.S. Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so logging trucks could remove the timber without rumbling through the tourist-clogged village. Allender said he became confused when building it because surveyors had left three proposed routes marked with ribbons through the wilderness. 

 The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million expansion project. 

 Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx. Last fall, a group calling itself Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for an outbreak of fires at the resort that caused $12 million in damage. 

 In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix the damage to the wetlands.
