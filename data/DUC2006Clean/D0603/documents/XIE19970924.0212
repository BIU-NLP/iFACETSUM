KUNMING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Local sources report that effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands, Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in southwest China's Yunnan Province. 

 Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge sewage and conserve water, according to experts. Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl. 

 The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is divided into two major sections -- Beihai Marshland and Qinghai Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation. 

 The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory birds. 

 The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992, and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued wide-ranging regulations to protect the area. 

 Planned afforestation has been carried out in the reserve and surrounding areas in recent years, with strict regulations in place to prohibit poaching. The local governments at all levels have also extended great efforts to teach people to cherish the natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.
