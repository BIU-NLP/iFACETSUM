LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain plans to continue its bid to reach and rescue the 118 Russian sailors in a sunken submarine even though virtually all hope of finding survivors has faded, British Defence Ministry said here on Saturday. 

 The ministry said British and Russian naval officers are liaising on how to mount a last-ditch rescue attempt after a British team with a manned mini-submarine arrived at the scene at 1600 GMT and reported weather conditions to be "almost perfect" for their mission. 

 But Vice-Admiral Mikhail Motsak, the head of Russia's Northern Fleet, said earlier that there is now virtually no hope of any survivors among the 118 crewmembers on board the submarine Kursk. 

 Moreover, he said, there was no hope that normal air pressure had been maintained in the rear sections - SOS signals hammered out by sailors trapped there soon after the accident indicated water had broken through. 

 It is not clear yet whether the British team will be given the chance to make a rescue attempt before a decision is taken by the Russians. 

 Commander Alan Hoskins, who is organizing the British effort at the scene, said they would continue offering assistance until the Russians told them to stop. 

 Russian rescue submarines had made four unsuccessful attempts to dock with the Kursk overnight. A spokesman said damage to the escape hatch was proving "an insurmountable obstacle." 

 Russian officials said there is no reason to believe the British mini-submarine and its crew, whose assistance was formally requested on Wednesday, will perform any better. 

 Despite the gloomy outlook, the British submarine's chief pilot, Tim Heron, believes they may still be able to save lives with their state-of-the art technology. 

 "(The British mini-submarine) can move like an underwater helicopter, up and down, round about and backwards and forwards," he said. 

 A second vessel carrying British and Norwegian divers is due to arrive at the scene of the disaster on Sunday.
