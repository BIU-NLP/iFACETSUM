MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy spokesman denied any such discovery. 

 Col. Gen. Valery Manilov offered no evidence for the claim, which he said supported the theory that a collision with a foreign vessel caused the explosions that killed the Kursk's 118-man crew Aug. 12. 

 Manilov told a news conference that Russian rescuers discovered the mysterious object 50 yards from the sunken Kursk, and was being guarded by ships from Russia's Northern Fleet. He did not say when or how it was located or give other details, according to Russian news reports. 

 The chief spokesman for the Northern Fleet, Vladimir Navrotsky, said no such object was found when the Kursk was studied last week, according to the Russian news web site Gazeta.ru. 

 The navy press office could not be reached for comment Monday night. 

 The cause of the two explosions remains unclear. Military officials claim the most likely scenario is that the Kursk struck another vessel, probably a foreign submarine. The U.S. and British navies have denied any collision, and the Russians have offered no evidence. 

 Some observers blame an internal malfunction and explosion in the submarine's torpedo compartment. Russian officials have also not ruled out that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.
