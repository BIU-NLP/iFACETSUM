MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia wants to begin efforts to recover the bodies of 118 men who died aboard the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk in September by cutting holes in the vessel's hull, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday. 

 Klebanov, chairman of the commission investigating the Aug. 12 disaster when the submarine sank after shattering explosions, rejected reports that the Kursk was testing a new type of torpedo that used a liquid fuel system that some officers considered unstable. 

 Russian officials maintain that the Kursk collided with a large object such as a foreign submarine, or with a World War II mine, but they have also considered the possibility that a torpedo inside the submarine misfired. 

 ''There were no new torpedoes on the submarine,'' Klebanov said after a commission meeting in St. Petersburg. He said the torpedoes aboard had been used for 20 years, although he added they had been fitted with a new model of battery. 

 Klebanov said the commission, after considering several methods of recovering the bodies, would recommend to President Vladimir Putin that the work be done by cutting holes in the submarine. 

 If approved, that work could begin in late September and would by done by diver teams of two Russians and one Norwegian, Klebanov said. 

 Igor Spassky, head of the Rubin submarine design bureau, which designed the Kursk, told the NTV television channel that the method would ''enable the divers to freely get into every compartment of the submarine and evacuate the bodies to accompanying vessels.'' 

 Klebanov also said the commission would give Putin a proposal on Wednesday for lifting the huge submarine to the surface, but he provided no details other than to say the project would take about a year and cost about $100 million. 

 Just removing the bodies would cost $5-7 million, Klebanov said. Even the smaller amount is a severe expense for the cash-strapped government, but Putin is under strong public pressure to recover the remains for burial. 

 Putin's government was sharply criticized for its handling of the disaster and its delay in accepting offers of help in the rescue effort from Norway and Britain. Family members have said some of the crew could have been saved. 

 Officials said medical experts should be able to identify the victims even if they were burned in the blast and have deteriorated underwater. 

 ''There is always a number on each crewman's clothing to identify him,'' said navy Capt. Dmitry Litovkin, a military commentator for the armed forces' newspaper Red Star. 

 ''It's hard to say whether the bodies are whole, but medical experts will be able to recognize them,'' Litovkin said. 

 However, other experts contend that the force of the blast would have mutilated the bodies, and any remains would be carried away by sea currents or eaten by fish and plankton. 

 The Stolt Offshore oil services company, a Norwegian company that sent divers to the Kursk, is negotiating with the Russians to raise the submarine. 

 Officials have also considered cutting the submarine into segments or raising it with pontoons, but that could set off any weapons still on the submarine or damage its two nuclear reactors. Russian and Western officials have said they have detected no radiation leaks so far.
