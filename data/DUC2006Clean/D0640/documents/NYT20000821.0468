Russian officials' assertions on Monday that the Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the Cold War, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another. 

 The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view, amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy subs quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian navy contends. 

 Pentagon officials have repeatedly denied that any American submarine collided with the Kursk, which plunged to the seabed on Aug. 12. An intense rescue operation ended on Monday when the Russians concluded that all 118 sailors had died in the wreckage. 

 U.S. officials have said that two American submarines were in the Barents Sea to monitor a Russian naval exercise that included the Kursk. But they have said that neither submarine was close to the Russian vessel. British officials also denied any involvement on Monday, saying they had no submarines in the Barents Sea. 

 Since the Cold War ended, the tenor of the cat-and-mouse game, in which the submarines chased one another to test the other side's capabilities, has grown less aggressive. 

 American officials even called Russian leaders to apologize shortly after each of the last two collisions occurred, in the early 1990s. And given the West's efforts to support democracy in Russia, some naval experts said they could not conceive of a situation in which American or British officials would attempt to cover up a tragic accident now. 

 Norman Friedman, an independent navy expert in New York, said that he believes the Russian naval officials were trying to deflect the blame for their own mistakes. 

 Based on the evidence that has surfaced so far, he said it seemed ``incredibly unlikely'' that the Kursk had suffered a collision, especially with a foreign submarine. ``There are so many other possibilities that you would have to rule out before you focused on something as strange as that,'' he said. 

 American navy officials and several experts like Friedman have said that it was more likely that the Kursk sank after one of its weapons, like a torpedo, exploded on board. 

 Over the last week, Russian navy leaders also have cited the possibility of a torpedo accident. There also was a chance, they said, that the Kursk could have struck a floating mine left over from World War II. 

 But time after time, several Russian officials have brought up the idea of a collision with a Western sub. And the Russian defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, said on Monday that a commission of experienced navy officials had endorsed this view. 

 He said that after the Kursk shot a buoy to the surface to warn that it was in trouble, men on two Russian ships detected signs of a large underwater object ``equivalent in size'' to the Kursk. But he said a ship designed to survey the seabed could not find this object later. 

 Former submariners say that many of the collisions have occurred because submarines have to navigate by interpreting sounds filtered through their sonar equipment. When two boats get close to each other, even a small mistake by one in plotting the other's course can cause them to collide. 

 In most of the collisions during the Cold War, the Western and Russian subs sustained only minor damage, like scratched hulls. The Western subs generally were under orders to remain undetected, so they never surfaced to try to aid the Soviet vessels. 

 In the most serious incident, the Tautog, a nuclear-powered attack submarine, collided in 1970 with a Soviet submarine close to Russia's Pacific coast. 

 The Soviet vessel, which was also operating under nuclear power, sustained so much damage, former American officials have said, that it was reported to President Nixon that the submarine had sunk. It was only in recent years that enough information became available in Russia to determine that while the submarine was severely damaged, it had limped back to port. 

 The last collisions between American and Russian subs occurred in 1992 and 1993. In a break from Cold War secrecy, both the Bush and Clinton administrations disclosed the accidents publicly. 

 Both presidents also reduced the frequency of the reconnaissance missions off Russia and ordered American subs to maintain greater distances from Russian vessels.
