LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine, there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task. 

 Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet below the surface were foundering. 

 A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard were heightening steadily Tuesday night. 

 Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday. 

 If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton pontoons, navy officials said. 

 About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons. 

 Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by tapping on the hull. 

 A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need to lie or sit down.'' 

 In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,'' he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.'' 

 Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a Black Sea resort. 

 Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance, even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain. 

 However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to media reports. 

 A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic. 

 The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could provide. The Russians initiated the meeting. 

 The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30 minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information, Russia will decide whether to make an official request. 

 The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the Eastern Atlantic naval command. 

 The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's Defense Information Group. 

 ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,'' Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.'' 

 Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and arrive in about the same time-frame, he said. 

 The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver said. edo chamber, which contains warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties, analysts said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 

 Several compartments inside the submarine were floodeds that can be sealed off in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate the submarine if several compartments, including the control center, are flooded. 

 A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the difficulties of the rescue in a teland also listing sharply to one side. As a result, the capsules and other devices are sliding off the vessel's hull, he said. 

 Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailorsarked all our work,'' he said. 

 Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late Saturday or early Sunday. 

 The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the Russian fleet, was commissioned only five years ago and representssia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to the environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the reactor that powers its engines had been shut down. Officials in Norway said there was no sign of a radiation leak.
