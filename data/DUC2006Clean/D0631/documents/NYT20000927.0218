PARIS _ Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July. 

 French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff. All 109 people aboard were killed as well as five on the ground. 

 Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit, saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a small wooden hotel. 

 The statement said that under the civil aviation legal code, an airline is responsible for damage caused by any pieces that fall off its aircraft. 

 Three weeks ago, Continental acknowledged that a strip of metal found on the runway among debris from the plane was similar in shape to a piece missing from its DC-10, which had been heading for New Jersey just minutes before the doomed Concorde took off. 

 French investigators believe the strip shredded one of the Concorde's tires, sending huge chunks of rubber through the jet's fuel tanks. 

 Continental issued a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that there was not proof that it was linked to the crash. ``At this stage in the investigation there is no conclusive evidence that Continental is involved in the Concorde crash,'' the statement said. ``Continental will continue to cooperate fully with all the French authorities investigating the accident.'' 

 The legal case was lodged by Air France and the airline insurance consortium Reunion Aerienne. 

 Industry experts said it was rare for airlines to sue each other, but somewhat logical in this particular case. 

 ``These are very unusual circumstances,'' said Shephard Melzer, who recently stepped down as the chairman of the Aeronautic Committee of the Association of the Bar of New York City. ``Usually it's a manufacturer who gets sued for a defective part. But here that is not the issue.'' 

 Melzer said it was really the insurance companies that called the shots in such lawsuits. ``Which insurance company is going to pay?'' he asked. ``That's what this is about. And from Air France's point of view, you can see the advantages. They are saying there was nothing wrong with their plane. It was really a freak accident.'' 

 Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble. Flames could be seen engulfing its left wing. But the plane was going too fast for the pilots to abort the takeoff. Instead, they tried to land at a smaller airport just a few minutes away. The plane lost altitude, however, and crashed into the hotel. 

 French and British aviation authorities last month withdrew Concorde's airworthiness certificate, saying a ruptured tire should not bring a plane down. Air France and British Airways, the only two airlines to operate the supersonic jets, have been studying whether corrective actions can be taken to insure that such an accident could not occur again. Before the crash, the planes had one of the best safety records.
