NEW YORK _ The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies _ or any movies, for that matter _ but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven to nine hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative discomfort, Concorde passengers said Wednesday. 

 In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris, killing all 109 people on the airplane and four people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again. 

 ``When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified,'' said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri. His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe. But Demsey said that he was ready to take his flight even after he heard about the crash. 

 ``Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or better than any other plane,'' he said. ``I would definitely fly it again.'' 

 British Airways, the only other airline that flies the Concorde, resumed its New York to London service Wednesday after having canceled some flights Tuesday. 

 Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool. But that is how many of its denizens refer to it. Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the rest are celebrities, the superrich or vacationers like members of the German tour group who died in Tuesday's crash. 

 For business executives, the advantage of the Concorde, which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 mph, twice as fast, is not just the time saved in the air. It is also the time saved on the ground. 

 British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel. Concorde passengers can arrive a half hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration. Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of arrival. 

 Celebrities like the Concorde's exclusivity because it separates them from the common folk on commercial flights. Executives like it because they can socialize with celebrities. They can also network, though that is not always a good thing. 

 The Concorde's 100-seat cabin is so small it is hard to work without your neighbors peeking over your shoulder. Wall Street executives have been known to pick up the whiff of a deal after bumping into a competitor with a client. 

 The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London, hop on the 7 p.m. Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m. 

 With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel back and forth to Europe on a regular basis. 

 ``I certainly don't take it for the luxury,'' said Emmanuel A. Kampouris, former chairman of American Standard Companies, who had just arrived on the 7 p.m. British Airways Concorde from London Wednesday. ``It's not comfortable. Sometimes it is really cold, or sometimes it is really hot but it is unbelievably convenient. You arrive before you leave.'' 

 The only reason he flew the Concorde Wednesday was because he had a meeting in London Wednesday and another in New York Thursday. His wife, Camille, who accompanied him, was pleased because they now had time to go out for dinner in New York. 

 The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day. Indeed, the Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent in the afternoon. The alternative for many travelers is to take an overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane. 

 ``I don't sleep well on planes,'' Demsey said. ``To me it buys back two days.'' 

 Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare of more than $10,000 roundtrip. Most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent, or the price of a business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050. 

 Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde. 

 ``It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim,'' Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde. If they did not fly supersonic, they would fly first class, which is only a few thousand dollars cheaper. Most of his customers believe that the added cost is well worth it since it means they can do more business. 

 ``For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does pay for itself,'' he said.
