PARIS _ Standing on the steps of Sacre-Coeur, the imposing basilica that sits on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris, the old woman held rosary beads in veiny hands. 

 She said that her name was Madame Morauw, and that she had just prayed for the 113 people, nearly all of them Germans, who were killed Tuesday as a Concorde jet crashed just after takeoff, just outside Paris. 

 Asked if any of her family had suffered under the Germans during the war, she nodded her head and said, ``Oui, trop.'' Too much. 

 The woman seemed to know where the line of questioning was going. She raised a finger to abruptly silence her questioner. 

 ``That was a long time ago,'' Madame Morauw said. ``The French and Germans are together now.'' 

 The crash, the first fatal accident involving the supersonic Concorde, redemonstrated that there is no such thing as an infallible airliner. the reaction to the tragedy has also shown a remarkable transformation in the relationship between France and Germany since World War II. 

 Sixty years ago the Nazis bombed Paris and occupied France. By the time Paris was liberated in August 1944, the Nazis had earned the hatred of the French people. 

 Nazi soldiers took special delight in drinking and carousing around the Eiffel Tower, taunting the French by turning a national symbol of French pride into a celebration of domination. 

 Wednesday, Joseph Meinel, a German tourist, stood in line, waiting for a chance to ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower. 

 ``Everywhere I have gone the last two days, French people have said they were sorry about what happened to the Concorde, that they were sorry for the Germans who were killed,'' said Meinel, who lives near Berlin and who said he has come to France regularly over the years. 

 ``I have never been treated with anything but respect,'' he said. 

 Hours before the crash, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, had given a speech in Frankfurt, lauding the friendship between France and Germany, saying the two countries were the undisputed leaders of the European Union and of the drive for greater European integration. 

 Schroeder spoke of what he called ``the French-German motor'' that drives European integration, an unfortunate choice of words given the engine failure that seems to have sent the Air France Concorde crashing in a fireball near Charles de Gaulle Airport. 

 It was de Gaulle who led the French resistance to the Third Reich, and last month, the German government invited the Gaullist president of France, Jacques Chirac, to be the first foreigner to speak at the newly reopened Reichstag in Berlin. In that speech, Chirac celebrated the close relationship between the two nations, saying it was their destiny to lead a united Europe. 

 The French backed the American revolution and gave the United States the Statue of Liberty as a gift, while the Americans twice sent their armies to help liberate France from the Germans in the last two world wars. 

 Conversations with many French reveal that they see Germans as more natural and important allies. Americans are routinely decried in France as being too powerful, too arrogant and too disdainful of the French and other European allies. 

 The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, has called the United States a ``hyperpower.'' (In France, huge supermarkets with hardware sections are called ``hypermarkets.'') 

 Vedrine and his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, have repeatedly tried to persuade Britain, their historical shared enemy, of joining them as leaders of the European Union _ an invitation the British have continually declined, viewing the Germans and French with equal suspicion. 

 In his speech before the crash, Schroeder, whose father was a German solider who died in battle three days before Schroeder was born in 1944, said that ``German-French relations have not been this good for a long time.'' 

 Hours later, after learning that almost all of the passengers who died on the French plane were German, a somber Schroeder said, ``Germany and France are united in their horror over the accident.'' 

 France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, was visibly shaken after touring the scene of devastation. He said he was mourning ``the victims, the flight crew, and our German friends.'' 

 Maria Nelson, an Irishwoman married to a Frenchman, agreed that relations between the two former bitter enemies have improved dramatically in the 14 years that she has lived in France. But she says the French bitterness, especially in the older generation, is just below the surface. 

 ``You hear remarks about Nazis,'' she said. ``You don't have to dig too deep, especially with older people who lived through the war.'' 

 Yet that bitterness was hard to find Wednesday as the sun shone and the French came to terms with the loss of both a symbol of French ingenuity and of more than 100 people, many of whose parents and grandparents would have been part of an army that occupied France just 60 years ago. 

 Madame Morauw said it best, just before she gingerly descended the stairs at Sacre-Coeur Wednesday. 

 ``Germans bleed,'' the old woman said, ``just like us.''
