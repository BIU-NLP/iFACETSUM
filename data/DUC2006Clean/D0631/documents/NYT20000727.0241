GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off , and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear, government investigators said Thursday. 

 The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or BEA, also said in a statement. 

 Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes'' recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No. 1 engine malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off. This engine was next to the No. 2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and burst into flame as the aircraft took flight. 

 ``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the parameters of engine No. 1 decreased again, the plane lurched strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said. ``In the sound recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No. 2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up. 

 ``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No. 2 lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No. 1 temporarily lost power,'' according to the statement. 

 Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said. 

 A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting off a chain reaction. ``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond Auffray told the BBC. 

 Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed grounded as the investigation 

 progressed Thursday. British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday. 

 The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of technical information including mechanical readings and the aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday. 

 Government experts have extracted all the information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday, adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of August. 

 The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris. 

 Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of the fire, investigators said. 

 The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members. Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground. Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a 10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France Soir reported Thursday. 

 Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed. He told the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing. 

 Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside. 

 Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all 113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to a medical institute in Paris for examination. Most were burned beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by dental records or DNA tests. 

 After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of clothing _ that might help identify the victims. ``The bodies are terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press. 

 Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in central Paris to pay their respects to the victims. It is the same church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess Diana here in 1998. 

 The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the families of many of those who died. German relatives of the victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses provided by the Paris Airports Authority. Many wore dark glasses in the bright summer sunshine. 

 Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted mourners. Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute. President Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers. 

 A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope.'' 

 At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France employees observed a moment of silence. A similar ceremony took place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served by Air France. 

 Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs. 

 Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to hold a silent march to the crash site Friday. Merchants said they would close shop to honor the dead. 

 Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary injury.'' 

 And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's thrust reverser. Such an investigation is not unusual in France following such a large accident.
