PARIS (AP) -- His supersonic jet aflame and two engines failing, Christian Marty, captain of the doomed Concorde flight, tried to gain speed for an emergency landing less than two minutes after takeoff. 

 ''Concorde zero ... 4590, You have flames. You have flames behind you,'' the control tower warned. 

 Seconds later came Marty's chilling word: ''Too late.'' 

 A preliminary report on the crash posted on the Internet Thursday by French investigators provides a graphic account of the final moments of Air France flight 4590 -- a chillingly professional cockpit exchange that indicates the control tower gave the first alert of trouble but that the crew was powerless to change their aircraft's course. 

 The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground. 

 The 75-page report by France's Accident and Inquiry Office, the BEA, underscores that the crew was unaware, then unable, to correct a trajectory toward disaster. The flaming plane slammed into a small hotel, decimating it, and was partially embedded in the ground. 

 Both France and Britain -- the only countries with supersonic fleets -- last month withdrew the Concorde's airworthiness certification while the investigation proceeds. The BEA, which draws no conclusions in its report, planned a news conference Friday. Its final report is not expected for at least a year. A judicial investigation also is in progress. 

 The report gives a second-by-second description of events. 

 It was 4:43 p.m. The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at breathtaking speed. 

 Seven seconds after the message from the control tower at Charles de Gaulle airport, the chief navigator confirmed, ''Breakdown eng... breakdown engine two.'' 

 ''Cut engine two,'' he said, four seconds later. 

 The aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing. But Marty could be heard saying: ''Too late.'' 

 The control tower was trying to coax the Concorde back to runway 26, where it had taken off. 

 ''Negative. We're trying for Le Bourget,'' a small nearby airport, the copilot responded. It was 4:44 p.m. and 22 seconds. There were some sounds similar to exertion. Nine seconds later all was silent. 

 ''The crew had neither the means to be aware of the nature of the fire nor to fight it,'' the report said. 

 The report stresses that it was the destruction of a forward tire on the left landing gear -- gashed by a 16-inch stray piece of metal on the runway -- that likely triggered a chain of events dooming the flight. Yet there was no indication from the transcript of cockpit conversation that the crew was aware of a problem. 

 ''It's burning badly, and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine,'' said someone in the control tower. ''Gong'' sounds were periodically recorded inside the plane. 

 Investigators believe that heavy chunks of rubber from the burst Goodyear tire damaged the fuel tanks located in the Concorde's delta-shaped wings. 

 Less than two minutes had elapsed from the time the tire was gashed to the time the plane crashed, the report said. The flames appeared less than a minute after takeoff. 

 The highly technical report contains simple, telling photographs, like that of a nearly 9-pound tire part with a nearly 13-inch gash, the bent metal strip that destroyed the tire and the crash site. 

 After the tire was gashed, a fire appeared under the left wing, the report said, followed by problems on engines No. 1 and 2. ''The plane can neither gain altitude nor accelerate. The crew notes that the landing gears cannot be lifted.'' Then the motor stops. 

 ''The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...,'' the control tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds. 

 A minute later, the control tower sent out a general message: ''For all planes listening, I'll get back to you in a minute. We're going to pull ourselves together and restart takeoffs.''
