GONESSE, France (AP) -- One month after an Air France Concorde crashed outside Paris, victims' relatives gathered Saturday to remember their loved ones near the site where the supersonic jet went down. 

 Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris. 

 Most of the crash victims were Germans flying to New York to join a luxury cruise through the Caribbean. 

 Journalists were not allowed to approach the site Saturday. Family members were seen crying and holding red carnations after a brief visit to the site. 

 A technical investigation is being carried out by the Accident and Inquiry Office, a part of the French Transportation Ministry. The office is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash on August 31. 

 British Airways, the only other airliner to operate the Concorde, suspended its flights on August 15.
