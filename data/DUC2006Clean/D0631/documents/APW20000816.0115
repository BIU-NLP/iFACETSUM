LONDON (AP) -- The grounding of the Concorde left a hole at the top end of the travel market, reducing the rich and famous to the same subsonic pace as the rest of humanity. 

 ''Of course, for people who used it, it's a disaster in two areas: It got you there quickly, and it got you there more interestingly,'' British film director Michael Winner said Wednesday. ''And you met a better class of people in the lounge.'' 

 The decision by British and French authorities to suspend certification of the supersonic plane leaves executives, celebrities and the merely wealthy with no alternative for cutting the time of a trans-Atlantic flight. 

 Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people. British Airways, which has seven Concordes, persisted until crash investigators discovered that the failure of a tire was the primary cause of the disaster -- and could threaten other flights. 

 Opera singer Placido Domingo said he has taken the Concorde many times and ''always appreciated the fact that it got me to my destination in a miraculously short time and safely.'' 

 ''I'm appreciating it doubly now that they have taken the precaution of grounding the planes until they know all the pertinent facts about this terrible tragedy,'' said Domingo, who is in Austria at the Salzburg festival. 

 ''It is a tragedy and a shattering blow for this country if it is the end of Concorde,'' noted food critic Egon Ronay told The Times of London. ''It is such a prestigious brand and something Britain was known for.'' 

 Travel agents already are hearing from customers. 

 ''I have only one couple -- a very big philanthropist -- they are very upset that they have to go on subsonic flight,'' said Rina Anoussi, owner of The Travel Business in New York City. 

 Grounding Concorde ''will affect a lot of people because of the extraordinary savings of time. I have a lot of people who love the London Concorde for the time, for the prestige,'' Anoussi said. 

 And people love the Concorde for the chance to sit near a celebrity -- whether it be Michael Jackson, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Margaret Thatcher or Mike Tyson. 

 Celebrities, however, are a small slice of the Concorde market. 

 ''It's mainly businessmen, average age around 40 -- sort of bankers, that sort of thing,'' said Steve Miller of Air News, a news agency based at Heathrow airport. ''And you get a very small percentage of people who have saved up their money for a once-in-a-lifetime treat. You get cruise passengers as well.'' 

 British Airways promised Wednesday to seek urgent meetings with the plane's makers and regulators to get the supersonic jets back in the air. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority stripped the airline's Concordes of permission to fly after investigators said a burst tire probably caused the deadly crash. 

 The Air France Concordes were already grounded; French aviation officials also suspended their flight certification Wednesday. 

 British aviation authority chairman Sir Malcolm Field said the Concorde's certificate of airworthiness would remain suspended until ''appropriate measures'' had been taken to ensure the safety of the aircraft's tires. 

 Despite the crash and the actions of French and British officials, Concorde retained its allure for many flyers. 

 ''I'd get on it in a minute,'' said American film director John Waters, who confessed he never flew the Concorde. ''What will be will be,'' Water said from Baltimore. ''I'm scared of cars, not planes.''
