BERNALILLO, N.M. _ With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation. Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in the sky to the east. 

 Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is a giant neon star bearing the words ``Star Casino.'' Next to the casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole championship course. And just beyond that, construction is under way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course. 

 After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations. But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these people have for generations cherished and protected from outside intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside. 

 ``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here. His tribe is divided over whether they, too, should develop a casino resort. ``We're trading our souls for money,'' he said. ``Some tribe members say `Hey, it's OK. It's glamorous.' But that's not what we are supposed to be. We are supposed to be stewards of this land. And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this stuff to take over.'' 

 With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations. But a once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder. Critics worry that tourists will trample across what they consider to be religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes are forming are increasingly being operated by outside professionals and managers. 

 ``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe. But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way.'' Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions. ``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said. ``But then more of the Las Vegas types started moving in.'' 

 Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what appears to be progress. Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in gambling revenues. And although there is still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are being made to augment the success of gambling. Several tribes are expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts, and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo. 

 Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Corp. to build what is being billed as ``New Mexico's first major golf and spa resort.'' The 350-room resort hotel will occupy a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is located 15 miles north of Albuquerque. The tribe will own the resort and Hyatt will manage it. Additionally, the tribe is doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las Vegas-style theater. A retail shopping center is proposed for a nearby section of the reservation. 

 Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation, next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse. This year, the tribe will host major golf tournaments, including the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club Championship.

 As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to increase economic opportunities. With pending lawsuits and other initiatives that could shut down their casinos or lead to heavy taxes on their revenues, they say they are creating an industry that can survive even if the casinos do not. ``There are so many attacks on Indian casinos,'' said Roy Montoya, who as chief administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business development. ``What the new resort represents is another step toward self-sufficiency.'' 

 Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to private business has created two camps. The traditionalists are leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand. 

 As the profits from gambling began to add up, ``we considered two approaches,'' Montoya said during an interview in his plain but comfortable office on the reservation. ``Some people said stash the money. Don't do anything with it. But we chose to put these different ventures in place.'' 

 The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by the economic growth. ``Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation,'' he said. ``Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak. But with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will become stronger again.'' 

 The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning. When the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from ``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious sites. 

 ``But the business types said they needed that site next to the river, overlooking the mountains,'' said Leon, whose grandfather held the revered religious title of medicine man. The business interests prevailed. As a result, Leon lamented: ``The religious people are upset with us. They worry that the public will wander over the reservation.'' 

 One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the tribe's history. Such museums are becoming a common element in casino and resort developments on reservations. &QL; 

 Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation. But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the growth. Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values and customs. ``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino,'' he said. 

 Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created. 

 One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across Highway 47 from the tribe's casino. Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _ better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes for him. 

 ``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course. ``But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro.'' 

 Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some. 

 ``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe. ``I'm amazed that many of the tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives. They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and accountants _ white attorneys and accountants.'' 

 But if appearances count for anything, Roy Montoya appears to be in control at Santa Ana. One day recently, he walked into a closed-door meeting of casino executives because he wanted to have a word with the casino's general manager, a Las Vegas transplant. Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices, interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who were huddled around a conference table. When Montoya entered, they all popped to their feet, smiling broadly. ``We own everything 100 percent,'' Montoya said. ``All of these people are on contract, just like out in the rest of the world.'' 

 Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two years, when current development projects are complete, that number is projected to reach 700 _ more employees than tribal members. ``When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was just called Roy,'' said the 58-year-old Montoya. ``Now people call me sir. But I'm still Roy. I get uncomfortable with sir.''
