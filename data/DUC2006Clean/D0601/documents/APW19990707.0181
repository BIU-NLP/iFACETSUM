PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- President Clinton turned the attention of his national poverty tour today to arguably the poorest, most forgotten U.S. citizens of them all: American Indians. 

 Clinton was going to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a visit with the Oglala Sioux nation and to participate in a conference on Native American homeownership and economic development. He also was touring a housing facility and signing a pact with Oglala leaders establishing an empowerment zone for Pine Ridge. 

 But the main purpose of the visit -- the first to a reservation by a president since Franklin Roosevelt -- was simply to pay attention to American Indians, who are so raked by grinding poverty that Clinton's own advisers suggested he come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' plight. 

 At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official attention: ``Welcome President Clinton. Remember Our Treaties,'' the sign read. 

 According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near reservations. Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races combined. 

 Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school graduates. Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in substandard housing. Twenty percent of Indian households on reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority -- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones. 

 The per capita income for Indians is $21,619, one-third less than the national per capita income of $35,225. An estimated 50 percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have jobs. 

 Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who visited the reservation last August, said Pine Ridge is a metaphor for the poverty tour, for it sits in Shannon County, the poorest census tract in the nation. 

 ``This is generations of poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation, with very, very little progress,'' Cuomo said. ``We didn't get into this situation in a couple of weeks and we're not going to get out of it in a couple of weeks. It's going to take years.'' 

 To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands. Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help streamline the mortgage lending process. 

 Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and own houses because the nature of the land on which they live effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes. 

 ``The land is held in trust. The bank doesn't want to take it as collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said. ``So the main asset on the reservation -- the land -- can't even be used.'' 

 Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K. Baum & Co., were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for five years to create a market for reservation mortgages. Those bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying homes.

 The announcement was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas.
