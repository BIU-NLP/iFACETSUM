SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified Wednesday. 

 After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied, bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre reservation, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander von Gernet. 

 McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which required Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions. Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands. 

 The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide whether the jury's award should be increased. 

 It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the University of Toronto. 

 It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said. Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes, he said. 

 That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified. It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said. 

 ''Congress was a newfangled institution. Colonial New York had a longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said. ''The idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in New York. It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary War.'' 

 The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said. 

 However, then Gov. George Clinton ignored the warnings and instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified. Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he said. 

 Von Gernet also testified: 

 -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for 22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about buying their reservation land. 

 -That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each follow its own course. The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the treaty binding. 

 Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position through achievement as opposed to inheriting them. 

 ''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn. 

 He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal by state lawmakers. 

 The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York except for the 64,000-acre reservation.
