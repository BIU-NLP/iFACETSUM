SPARTA, Ga. _ By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning, Hancock County is almost deserted. 

 A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging porches. But almost anyone who works has left the county hours before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock. 

 The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown. Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers _ and say no thanks. Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation. 

 Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month. But only 80 miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7 percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is a third less than the rest of the state. The county's leaders have begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants, a landfill, a waste incinerator. Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire. 

 So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling casino. For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else. 

 ``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending almost all his time on the casino project. ``Think about what all those tourists could do for us. We'd have the money to restore all those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts in town and maybe do historical re-enactments. It would give our people a chance to become independent.'' 

 The casino is a long way from becoming a reality. Among other hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact for a reservation, and Gov. Roy E. Barnes has said he was opposed to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery. (The federal government could approve the project if the state refuses.) But in the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to achieve a dream of prosperity. 

 The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe, sharing space in Wetumka, Okla., with the much larger Creek Nation, to whom they are related. Along with several other Creek tribes, they trace their origin to northern and central Georgia, from which they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Trail of Tears. The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere but has been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga., on the Alabama border west of Atlanta. 

 Carroll County residents, close enough to Atlanta to benefit from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the casino, but the reception has been very different in Hancock. Most residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the plantations in the area, and Hancock is one of a string of largely black counties stretching from Virginia to East Texas known as the Black Belt. Most of those counties are significantly more impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national bounty. 

 In May, after R. Allen Haywood, the editor and publisher of the weekly Sparta Ishmaelite, noticed an article about Carroll County's rejection, he suggested to Hancock County officials that they contact the tribe. Kialegee leaders were immediately interested, and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here last week. They were even more intrigued when they learned that there are several large Indian mounds in Hancock County, of unknown origin and dating back hundreds of years. 

 ``There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal members and the citizens of the county,'' said Kenneth R. Baldwin, who runs an investment group in McAlester, Okla., that is representing the Kialegees. ``They both have an understanding of what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities you'd like to have. The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere else they have been.'' 

 Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out of distress. But they have also seen marketing studies showing that there is no other full-fledged casino in Georgia, Florida or the Carolinas, and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed casino, hotel and golf course. Considering Hancock's current situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse. 

 ``This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs,'' Roberts said. ``Our history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what we want.''
