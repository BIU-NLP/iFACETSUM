WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said. 

 Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies. 

 ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas. 

 Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address last week, but did not mention any specifics. Those will be included in his 2001 budget proposal, to be announced next week. 

 Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said. 

 The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't address all the problems. 

 ``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to head the BIA in 1997. 

 Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical. 

 ``Senator Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does wonder why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a look at Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado Republican. 

 The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the estimated $4 billion backlog of needed repairs. And, according to an Interior Department report issued last year, $1.2 billion is needed to repair or replace 170 Indian schools. 

 ``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a drop,'' Cutler said. 

 Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care in the country. The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population. The Indian Health Service reports the Indian death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population. 

 Clinton will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31 tribal colleges, Cutler said. The colleges, which serve 26,000 students in 12 states, are a vital part of efforts to improve education and economic opportunities on reservations, she said. 

 A report to be released today says tribal colleges have created jobs and helped increase education levels on the reservations where they operate. The report from the Institute for Higher Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges. 

 Cutler said other details of Clinton's proposal include: 

 -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of Indian students. 

 -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators. 

 -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program aimed at attracting companies to reservation areas.
