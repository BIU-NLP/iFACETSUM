NEW YORK _ Nancy Smith, 28, croaks about the cold weather with a smoked-out voice. Dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, her puffy eyes tell a story of chronic alcoholism, an all-too-common syndrome among Native Americans like her. After returning from a cigarette break in sub-zero temperatures, Smith flops down on a couch, curls herself into a ball and falls asleep. One of New York City's homeless, she has come for the treatment of her drinking problem. 

 Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New York area. ``Where else can I go for help?'' she asks. ``Any place else, they don't understand you like they do here.'' 

 Native Americans around the country are leaving reservations and relocating in urban areas at a dizzying rate. With economic opportunities on reservations lagging behind those available in big cities, and with the unemployment rate among Native Americans at three times the national average, thousands of poor, often unskilled Native Americans are rushing off their reservations. Many find their new urban locales strange and forbidding and often turn to drugs and alcohol. 

 Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City metropolitan area. Of that number, nearly 7,000 come to the Community House each year for drug and alcohol rehabilitation, health counseling or for job training, according to Rosemary Richmond, executive director. This is up from around 3,000 just seven years ago. With the vast majority of its $1.5 million annual budget, mostly federal funds, going to substance abuse treatment and job training, the Community House finds itself at risk of losing the attendance of those in need of cultural support. 

 As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away. Richmond and her 30-member staff have been inundated with work, but less and less of it involves cultural activities. 

 ``I used to go there all the time and hang out, meet new people,'' says Carlos Rodriguez, 48, a Navajo who works as a librarian at Columbia University. ``Now most of the people there have drug problems, so they don't even let you in without an appointment.'' 

 The Community House, established in 1969, relies on volunteers like Rodriguez to participate in rallies, organize religious events and educate the public about Native American culture. In recent years, problems of illiteracy and addiction have become the major part of the organization's workload. 

 The social problems faced by Richmond and her staff are not unique to New York City. From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native American population has more than doubled. With this drastic increase came a surge in urban Native Americans in need of substance abuse treatment. In 1980, approximately 4,000 Native Americans sought treatment for substance abuse in the San Francisco area, according to the Indian Health Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Today, that number has more than doubled, to 9,200. In Seattle over the same period, addiction cases rose from 3,500 to 7,300. Over all, the rate of substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent nationwide. And the migration from the reservations continues. 

 ``Mostly, it's economics,'' says Joanne Dunne, a spokeswoman for the Boston Indian Council, a nonprofit cultural group. ``The reservation typically doesn't provide you with any real opportunities.'' Also, many Native Americans travel between the reservation and urban areas. ``Some tribes traditionally go from one place to another,'' says Dunne. ``The Micmacs always crossed the border from Canada to come from time immemorial.'' 

 In other cities, city and state governments have created agencies to specifically deal with the Native American population. In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs. ``There's also American Indian Health, which is nonprofit and state supported,'' adds Alycia Atkinson, an administrator at Urban Indian Affairs. ``They do youth programs, alcohol, tobacco and drug intervention, and other health services. Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city. And the state also supports the National American Indian Association here.'' As the state and city governments slice up their services, Detroit Native Americans, already a small group at 20,000, find themselves without a cultural or political center. 

 In Boston, at Dunne's Boston Indian Council, attendance lags because it does not provide substance abuse treatment, legal services or on-site training programs. Still, it creates a sense of community among members of 36 tribes from all over the nation. ``Indians are drawn together the same way as everyone else,'' she explains. ``You look for people who look like you.''  &QL;
