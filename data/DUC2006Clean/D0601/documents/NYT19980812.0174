NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest. 

 With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon. And he prays that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister.'' 

 McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale hunt in more than seven decades. He hopes it will renew the Olympic Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions. Opponents call the hunt butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are protected by international law. 

 McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one.'' 

 The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan. 

 The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the great whale. But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of international media and a thin phalanx of security. 

 The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right to kill up to 20 whales through 2002. Animal rights activists fear the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling, presently banned by the commission. 

 But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach, he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800 people living in his fishing village. Instead, he meditates and prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored guest of the village.'' 

 He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner. 

 McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s. He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United States. 

 The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means ``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls.'' 

 McCarty comes from a long line of whalers. His grandfather and great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to extinction by non-Indian whalers. McCarty's father, John, until recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission. 

 After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working with his father as a commercial fisherman. ``It became a passionate connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said. 

 Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River. ``We look upon the water as its own being,'' he said. 

 While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can. ... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one spirit.'' 

 Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to anthropological texts. Tribal members today remain guarded about saying too much about the hunt to outsiders. 

 ``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said. ``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling.'' 

 McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's hunt. ``In this day and age, it's important to say something about it,'' McCarty said. 

 To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that have been passed down from generation to generation and are still sung today. 

 One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning.'' 

 ``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a direct translation,'' he said. 

 McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long before they became news to the outside world. An accomplished carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont, McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to whaling and the sea. 

 ``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and where we come from.'' 

 The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called the Hummingbird. 

 ``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours, said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon. 

 Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence. McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide inspiration and a new focus for the community. 

 ``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,'' he said. Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle (substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it.'' 

 On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice. 

 A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie Hunter trailed the canoe. Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr. sat near Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern. In the background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note tune. 

 Eric would like to be a whaler someday. ``Yeah, I'm thinking about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said, becoming very serious. ``I think I would want to be the harpooner. If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you can stick it in the whale.'' 

 ``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of unemployment or Jim Beam. 

 Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came alongside. The men passed little Eric between boats. As he scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile transformed his serious face. 

 Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a .50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor. It will deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained Johnson, hefting the weapon. 

 The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by the Makah. The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick kill. Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill. That necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to the next world. I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a sacred way of life.'' 

 But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the gun, but also of the hunt itself. ``What are we building our culture on by going after something we don't want to eat?'' she asked. 

 That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not representing the will of the people. 

 But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more than other communities. 

 John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson Jr. and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office. 

 But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more than 70 years is a daunting challenge. So the Makah are turning for advice to other indigenous whalers. 

 Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling captains convention. They attended seminars on topics such as effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission. The tribe is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission. 

 The whaling crew members are also training together. They run together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer. The young men are learning to function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson. 

 The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice ``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty. 

 But many training methods will not be shared with the outside world. For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said McCarty. 

 ``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said McCarty without offering further explanation. 

 A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is the bridge it creates between generations. For example, John McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son Micah. 

 ``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father. ``He was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close enough to give him another harpoon. He went straight out to sea (dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether). 

 ``It was one fierce ride. The whale was relentless; the toughest whale they had ever seen. They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just a tiny bump. They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and floats. Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and headed home. The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the bottom of the canoe.'' 

 It is the telling of such stories across the generations that defines the Makah. When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said: ``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth. How can we describe that to the world?''
