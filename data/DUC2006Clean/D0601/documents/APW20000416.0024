ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- At Mesa Elementary School in far northwest New Mexico, Navajo children line up to use the few computers connected to the Internet. Their time online must be short for everyone to get a chance. 

 ''The Internet's not really available to me,'' said sixth-grader Altie Altieyazzie. 

 President Clinton was scheduled to visit the youngster's community of Shiprock on Monday as part of his New Markets Initiative to encourage economic development in depressed areas, a tour that focuses on the so-called ''digital divide'' that is leaving minority communities like Altie's behind. 

 Many in Shiprock hope Clinton's presence will spotlight conditions on the Navajo reservation that have kept most of its 8,000 residents from participating in the Internet information age. Poverty and the extremely rural nature of the sprawling reservation mean many homes don't have telephone connections, let alone computers. 

 ''We have a lot of needs, on any Native American reservation, and the Navajo Reservation is the same,'' said sixth-grade teacher Fannie L. Atcitty. ''We're still behind, which is affecting our schools, our students.'' 

 Officials at Mesa Elementary estimate that fewer than half of the families with children who attend the school have phone lines to their homes, a problem for emergencies as well as Internet access. 

 Altie, 12, said his family has a phone but no computer. ''For some people it's probably too expensive,'' he said. 

 The students have access to the school's computers on some days after classes, but many have long bus rides home and can't stay, said Principal Glojean Todacheene. 

 The limited time they get in school on the computers doesn't allow them to get comfortable enough to be considered computer literate, Atcitty said. 

 ''Every child should be computer literate,'' she said, ''but it's not really happening here.'' 

 There has been some progress over the past few months. 

 Tachyon Inc., a California-based company that provides wireless Internet service, gave the Lake Valley Navajo School a $30,000 satellite system last week to connect the school's computers to the Internet. School officials tried accessing the Internet by telephone line, but the connection was so poor it took as long as 40 minutes to find a Web site. The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the Navajo Nation. 

 A donation earlier this year from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, started by the founder of Microsoft, created a program to provide grants for computers and software for American Indian tribes in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. 

 A computer that is expected to be delivered to the Navajo Nation's Hogback chapter in August will be used by everyone from elementary school students to business people, said Anita Hayes, community services coordinator for the chapter, about four miles east of Shiprock. 

 Hayes said the Internet connection will provide information on jobs, education and other opportunities to members, and she hopes Clinton's visit will make it easier to get grants for more equipment. 

 ''There are a lot of reasons to have this access,'' she said, though not everyone is racing toward the Internet age. 

 ''Among the elderly, it's foreign to them,'' Hayes said. ''They're not saying too much about it. They're just observing, watching the children.'' 

 Clinton's plans Monday including speaking at Shiprock Boys/Girls Club, then joining an evening Webcast at Dine Tribal College in Shiprock that will involve high school student online at Lake Valley Navajo School, about 55 miles away.
