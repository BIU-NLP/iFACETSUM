CHICAGO _ A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern Nebraska found itself Friday at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins. 

 The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation. Friday that little casino nearly led a U.S. District Court judge in Omaha, Neb., to take an unprecedented step: the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling. 

 Although the judge, William Cambridge, ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory. Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3 1/2 years ago. 

 The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino. There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes. But Nebraska, opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding Friday. 

 That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation.

 Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations. The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas. The tribes' position was supported by Gov. Gray Davis, but the court ruled that it conflicted with the state constitution's ban on casino-style games like blackjack and 21. 

 In addition, Florida, Kansas and Alabama, trying to block the opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the U.S. Interior Department with the aim of overturning new rules that allow the federal government to license tribal casinos in cases where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts. 

 And Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson refused to renew one-year gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed to pay $22 million in lieu of taxes, up from $350,000 under the old one-year agreements. 

 ``Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with us,'' said Sheila Morago, a spokeswoman for the National Indian Gaming Association. ``Now that we have a small piece of the pie, they want our filling. It's just a constant intrusion on the treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign rights. Every time you get a little farther, you take one step forward and two steps back.''

 David Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the National Governors' Association, said that ``the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes.'' Rather, Rocchio said, ``the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos _ and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state.'' Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers. 

 The reservation of the Santee Sioux, the tribe involved in the court showdown in Nebraska on Friday, lies on the Missouri River just across the border with South Dakota, and is home to about 1,000 tribal members. 

 In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store. It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities. It takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 74 percent unemployment. Tribe chairman Arthur Denny said the casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence. 

 But Nebraska, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Santee Sioux. 

 Almost from the beginning, the U.S. attorney's office in Omaha has tried to get the casino shut down. A federal appeals court found the casino illegal in 1998, and the Supreme Court, without comment, let that ruling stand. 

 This February, Cambridge began fining the tribe $3,000 a day, and in June he doubled the fine, to $6,000 a day. None of the debt, now totaling $726,000, has been paid by the Santee Sioux, and the purpose of the hearing Friday was for Cambridge to consider whether to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt. 

 In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the leaders no longer had the authority to close it. He told the federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one. Why that would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely clear. 

 In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the Santee Sioux, saying the fines would continue. 

 It was not certain where the case would proceed from here. U.S. Attorney Thomas Monaghan said his office had several options, but he would not elaborate.
