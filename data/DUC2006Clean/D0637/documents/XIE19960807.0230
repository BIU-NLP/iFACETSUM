YINCHUAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Israeli Energy Ministry have agreed to cooperate with the Environmental Protection Bureau of northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to develop solar energy. 

 The first group of proposals includes forming a Sino-Israeli center to expand the use of solar energy in the region, and developing an energy-efficient solar water heater, which would be especially suited to sunny north China. 

 With reserves of coal, oil and gas, Ningxia is one of the country's major energy production centers. But the use of chemical-petroleum has caused serious pollution in many parts of the region, including the capital city of Yinchuan. 

 Scientists said that a quick way to settle the problem is to replace the chemical energy with solar energy. 

 The region has a large potential for solar energy, with 3,000 hours of sunshine a year and more than 140,000 calories of radiation energy per sq cm. 

 All previous experiments on the use of solar energy have failed, due to the lack of advanced science and technology. 

 Cooperation with Israel should lead to better results, regional officials believe.
