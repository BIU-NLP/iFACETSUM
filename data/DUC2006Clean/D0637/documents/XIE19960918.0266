HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing solar summit here this evening adopted a program on the development and utilization of solar and other renewable energy sources in the 10 years to come. 

 According to the "program on solar energy 1996-2005", 253 projects will be launched in various countries during the 10-year period to demonstrate the technical feasibility, economic viability and social and political acceptability of solar enrgy. 

 These projects are divided into five categories, namely, the rural electrification program, the global education and training program, the water desalination and purification program, the information and communication program, as well as the industrial policy, market penetration and technology transfer program. 

 Of these projects, some are identified as high-priority national projects and the others are high-priority regional projects and global projects of universal value. 

 The program says the World Solar Commission, which drew up the program, will accomplish these projects through mobilizing a concerted global effort with the continued cooperation and commitment of various governments, international organizations, bilateral and multilateral funding institutions, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, research organizations and universities. 

 These projets were all put forward by various governments at the request of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the past three years and decided by the World Solar Commission. 

 Chinese energy experts attending the summit said the program on solar energy is the most important document in the development and use of renewable energy sources in the next 10 years. 

 They said the energetic implementation of the program will greatly increase the level of developing and using the renewable energy sources and actively promote the preservation of the environment and the development of economy.
