KUNMING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in subtropical southwest China has become a leader of the country in the utilization of solar energy. 

 At present, the province has some 200 solar water heater plants with a combined annual production of more than 400,000 square meters. The products are well sold in northwest and southwest parts of China, and southeast Asian countries. 

 Yunnan Province, rich in solar energy, has set up a solar energy research center, the country's first station for inspecting the quality of solar water heaters and a key lab for rural energy resources projects. 

 The province has made marked progress in developing solar water heater, solar furnace, solar battery and basic theoretical research on the solar energy. 

 The use of solar energy saves the province more than 100 million kwh of electricity each year, local officials said. 

 Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers' University, the solar energy research base in the province, said that they are studying the possibility of building "solar energy houses," which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning, and are decorated with solar energy equipment.
