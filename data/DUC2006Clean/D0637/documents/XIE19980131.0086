KUNMING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Remote Yunnan Province in the southwestern part of China has become a leading solar energy producer, accounting for a quarter of the country's solar energy output. 

 The province can now produce 300,000 sq.m. of solar panels for solar-energy heaters each year, giving an annual solar-energy output of 400 kilowatts. 

 The products sell nationwide and in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Singapore, and Thailand as well. 

 With its heavy amount of solar radiation, the province has the equivalent of 69.5 billion tons of standard coal, or six times of the province's total coal reserves. 

 The solar energy is widely used in telecommunication, meteorology, earthquake forecasts, and forest fire prevention. The province has built over 30 solar-powered TV relay stations.
