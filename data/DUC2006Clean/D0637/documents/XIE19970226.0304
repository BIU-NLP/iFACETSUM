YAOUNDE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The seminar on solar energy and development opened in Yaounde today with emphasis on the advantages of solar energy in rural areas. 

 Participants mentioned that in most African countries, 70 percent of the population live in rural areas. However, the living communities are small and isolated with no access to electricity. 

 But they need electricity for pumping water and increasing production, one of the participants noted. 

 They cannot get it in the conventional way. But with solar energy, they can have electricity at a very low cost, participants said. 

 Solar energy is an important social economic asset especially in rural areas where electricity is still a rare commodity. 

 Forty participants from around the world attending the seminar will identify national projects to be involved within the framework of the world energy program aiming at developing solar energy in rural zone.
