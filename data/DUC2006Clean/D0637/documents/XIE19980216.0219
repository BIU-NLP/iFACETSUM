LHASA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Streetlights that are powered by solar energy have become a new feature in Lhasa, capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. 

 Early in the morning, people on their way to pray will stop and look with great interest at the lights by Dragon King Pool behind the Potala Palace. A special piece of silicon half a meter square at the top of a lightpole stores enough energy during the daytime to provide electricity for 68 lights on the roads near the pool all through the night. 

 The 820,000 yuan (98,700 US dollars) cost of the solar-energy streetlights came from the Beijing municipal government. It is estimated that the whole project will cost 15 million yuan. 

 Tibet has an average of 3,100 to 3,400 hours of sunlight annually in most areas because of its high elevation and thin air. 

 In order to make full use of the solar energy, the local government has spent more than 17 million yuan on solar-energy facilities to heat water, green houses, and solar-energy stoves. 

 Solar energy produces profits of about 80 million yuan each year in Tibet.
