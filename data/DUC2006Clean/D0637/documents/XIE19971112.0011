HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Israel are likely to enter into joint development of solar and renewable energy, an Israeli official said today. 

 Visiting Israeli Director of Energy Resources Management Department in the Ministry of National Infrastructure Joseph Nowarski said solar and renewable energy offers great potential for economic cooperation between Israel and Zimbabwe. 

 He said Zimbabwe's solar energy development infrastructure is at an advanced stage. 

 "I am on a two-day visit at the invitation of the Zimbabwean government which, after hosting the solar summit last year, feels responsible for continuing efforts to make solar energy more popular worldwide," he said. 

 During his stay, Nowarski is scheduled to meet officials from the Zimbabwean Ministry of Transport and Energy Wednesday to discuss possible areas of cooperation. 

 Israel, whose territory is 60 percent desert, is one of the leading world users of solar energy. 

 It carries out extensive solar research and development at a number of universities and institutions at desert to provide substantial amounts of solar-derived power. 

 Zimbabwe, with prolonged periods of sunshine throughout any given year, plans to maximize the use of solar energy in rural areas where 80 percent of the 12.4 million people live.
