YINCHUAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Solar energy will be utilized in a wide range of areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China, with the adoption of the Sunshine Plan made by the local government. 

 It will take three to five years to promote the use of solar energy in both remote mountain and comparatively well-off irrigated areas, and one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars) has been earmarked for the first phase of the plan. 

 With 3,000 hours of sunshine a year, Ningxia is one of China's regions ripe for the use of solar energy, and it has been developing the use of this energy source since the 1970s. 

 At present, thousands of solar powered appliances and dozens of solar-heated houses are in use in many parts of the region. 

 Apart from China's own expertise, Ningxia intends to learn from Israel, Germany, Japan and other countries which have made great achievements in the field of solar energy.
