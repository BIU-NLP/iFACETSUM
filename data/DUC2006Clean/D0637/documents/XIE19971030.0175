CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing trend in Egypt to take full advantage of the blessing of abundant sunshine and swift wind to diversify the country's energy source, said a top energy official. 

 The development of the two energy resources will add to the traditional and predominant power generation means through oil and hydro resources in meeting an ever-increasing energy need, which is growing at 12 to 14 percent yearly, said Minister of Electricity and Energy Osman Abaza. 

 Telling foreign reporters at a press conference here Wednesday evening, the minister expected the share of the solar and wind energy in the total will increase to five percent by the year 2005 from the current one percent. 

 He boasted his country's perpetual brilliant sunshine and powerful wind, saying the potential for exploration is vast. 

 Study showed good wind potential along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, South Sinai and the Oweinat oasis area in the Western Desert. 

 Investors, both public and private, are vying to inject money in renewable energy, the minister said, pointing to a national map to illustrate where giant windmills will be seen over the coming decades. 

 Research on wind energy started in Egypt in the 1980s, followed by the establishment of wind farms in such coastal cities as Hurghada, Ras Ghareb and Zafarana, according to Abaza. 

 The biggest wind project aided by German-Danish expertise is under construction in Zafarana, almost 200 kilometers south of Cairo. It will turn out half of the country's non-traditionally generated energy when it is completed at the start of the next century. 

 Solar energy, less exploited than the wind, is now used in the newly developed areas along the Red Sea, the northern coast and the areas where electricity is unavailable, he said. 

 But studies have found that the total annual solar radiation ranges from 1,800-2,500 kilowatts hour (kwh) per square meter, making Egypt one of the most suitable areas in the world for the exploitation of solar energy. 

 In 1996, Egypt generated around 54.4 billion kwh of electricity and consumed 45.6 billion kwh. By the year 2000, it is estimated, Egypt will need 101 billion kwh annually.
