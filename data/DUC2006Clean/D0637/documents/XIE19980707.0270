NEW YORK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- World solar markets are growing at ten times the rate of the oil industry, U.S. Worldwatch Institute reported on Monday. 

 Solar power has grown at 16 percent annually since 1990 compared to merely 1.4 percent for oil energy growth, the Washington-based institute said in a press release. 

 In 1997 alone, sales of solar cells expanded over 40 percent. 

 Solar power capacity has reached 800 megawatts, representing only less than one percent of global power supplies. 

 As governments move to implement the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and replace fossil fuels, solar power is poised to benefit. 

 The institute said for the 2 billion people worldwide who are not yet connected to power lines, solar energy is often the most affordable way to get electricity.
