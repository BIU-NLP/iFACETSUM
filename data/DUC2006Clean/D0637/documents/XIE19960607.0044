NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Harnessing the sun and selling it abroad, the u.s. solar industry is in export boom and u.s.-made solar panels are becoming popular in developing countries. 

 New York Times Wednesday released a set of pictures which shows a man from India in front of a solar-powered home, one of 50,000 to be converted; Tibetan herders using panels for electricity; and in Somalia, a traveling medical clinic using solar energy to keep vaccines cold in a refrigerator. 

 From India and Indonesia to Mexico and Brazil, solar panels made in America are spouting on thousands of roof-tops, lighting up jungles, deserts and other hard-to-wire areas of the developing world that have never been connected to conventional power grids. 

 All this means big business for the companies that make solar equipment in the United States. Statistics indicate that those companies are taking in 300 million u.s. dollars, or 30 percent of the worldwide market, making the United States the biggest center of solar manufacturing in the world. 

 The u. s Energy Department predicts that global sales will jump by 70 percent over the next five years.
