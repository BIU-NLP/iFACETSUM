WASHINGTON _ After George Bush lost the presidency to Bill Clinton in 1992, some Republicans blamed one of their own: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 

 Greenspan had first become involved in Republican politics during Richard M. Nixon's 1968 campaign, and he had been a fixture among the party's economic policy makers ever since. 

 He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and reappointed by Bush. But in the eyes of Bush's supporters, Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin: failing to bring the economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession. 

 Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in 1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was well under way by Election Day. 

 All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue. And it is already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Greenspan will figure into this political cycle. 

 The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats but from Republicans. In Iowa, where the Republicans battling to stay in the race against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the party's presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate for attention, both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the Fed and Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are plunging and farmers are hurting. 

 ``Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve raise rates, commodity prices have plummeted,'' Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa. Forbes goes on to blame monetary policy together with ``bad economic advice from the Clinton-Gore administration'' for the troubles plaguing agriculture. 

 Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Greenspan's ideological home. 

 Then again, Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all stripes because he never hits back, at least not publicly. Perhaps more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Greenspan as having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton administration. 

 They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half years as Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and now with his successor, Lawrence H. Summers, as well as with Clinton himself. And the party's more ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Greenspan told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for reducing taxes. 

 Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way _ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats. No one paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax cuts over additional government spending, which in the eyes of most Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country. 

 If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the next few months on splitting up the surplus, leaving the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail, Greenspan's name will no doubt be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions. 

 While fiscal policy can make for powerful politics, it is just a sideline for Greenspan. The far more compelling issue for him could be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm bells. 

 Politically, it will be a tough call; Greenspan would no doubt prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign. 

 Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Greenspan is still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven, financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off inflation. 

 Besides a dozen years' experience on the job and a tough skin, the Fed chairman has something else going for him. If there were a Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan's reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term. Vice President Al Gore has been equally supportive. 

 With that bipartisan support, Greenspan has considerable leeway in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions. 

 In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation against political attacks.
