WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his warnings Wednesday that the Fed will move again to raise interest rates if inflation appeared set to rise. 

 In his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan said once again, "If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive adjustment later." 

 Greenspan appears before Congress twice a year, at separate House and Senate hearings, to provide an update on the central bank's views. The assessment he gave senators wednesday was nearly identical to what he told members of the House Banking Committee on July 22. 

 Stock prices have retreated from all-time highs since that warning that the Fed is ready to nudge interest rates higher if the economy shows signs of overheating, such as rising consumer prices or labor costs. 

 Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock market investors who may think that the nation's eight-year economic expansion can continue indefinitely. 

 Greenspan said that 1999 has been "an exceptional year for the American economy," with almost 1.25 million jobs created and no pickup yet in consumer prices so far. 

 But he stressed the need for "preemptive policy-making" by the Fed should there be signs of trouble. 

 U.S. lawmakers, however, repeatedly asked the Fed chairman for his views on the budget surplus and how to use it rather than for his views on monetary policy. 

 He noted the uncertainty of projecting future government surpluses, which some members of Congress want to use to finance a tax cut and others want to earmark for various new programs. 

 "We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately, largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a great deal of good to the economy," Greenspan said. 

 Analysts said the tone of Greenspan's report to Congress is a strong indication that the Fed still may raise interest rates again before the end of this year.
