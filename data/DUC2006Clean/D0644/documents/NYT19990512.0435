WASHINGTON _ The stock market shrugged off news Wednesday that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is resigning, with the Dow Jones industrial average recouping most of the 213 points it lost in early trading. 

 The Dow finished down 25.78 points at 11,000.37, but the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.6 percent to set a record at 1,364. The Nasdaq composite finished up 1.6 percent.

 The initial reaction on Wall Street was attributed partly to the uncertainty about economic policy under Rubin's deputy and designated successor, Lawrence Summers. The news also provided an excuse to sell for investors already worried about the market's historically high level, said money manager Phillip M. Larkins of Legacy South in Atlanta. 

 A third reason for the early stumble may have been due to Rubin's relationship with Wall Street. Rubin is not only a Wall Street alumnus _ he headed the Goldman Sachs investment banking firm _ but like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, is well respected there. 

 ``Rubin is probably the only person who could take Greenspan's job without upsetting the market,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center in Atlanta. 

 The market's subsequent rebound came after investors had time to reflect on three things, Larkins suggested: 

 ``Rubin had indicated many times he would like to step down in the near future. 

 ``Secondly, I think people came to a conclusion that the worst of the global turmoil is behind us. 

 ``Third, it's been fairly well assumed that Larry Summers would replace him.'' 

 ``You hate to see him go, but the market was anticipating it,'' Larkins added. 

 ``There's been a lot that has happened on his watch, and most of it has been good,'' noted economist Mark Vitner of Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union bank. He cited the federal budget surplus and Rubin's handling of international financial crises, first in Mexico and then in Asia. 

 ``He was very protective. He was very, very determined that financial crisis overseas would not leak back to the United States,'' Vitner said. 

 He also noted that Summers has been the Treasury secretary's ``right-hand man.'' 

 ``It is not likely to represent that much of a change,'' he said. 

 Instead of viewing the news negatively, as the market did initially, a closer look might lead to a more optimistic outlook, Vitner said, echoing others. 

 ``People may come to the conclusion that Rubin thought the world economy is in good enough shape that he could step off the stage,'' Vitner said.
