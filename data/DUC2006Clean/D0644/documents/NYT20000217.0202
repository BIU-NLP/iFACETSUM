&UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Thursday that the powerhouse economy shows few signs of slowing despite four interest rate increases over the past eight months, and he warned that the central bank will probably raise rates further to avert a buildup of inflation pressures. 

 In testimony to the House Banking Committee, Greenspan said the current combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers was unprecedented in the half century he has spent monitoring the economy. 

 But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to take some steam out of the expansion, which this month became the longest on record at eight years and 11 months. 

 The Fed next meets to consider monetary policy on March 21, and economists said the tone of Greenspan's testimony Thursday all but ensured that the central bank would act then to raise its benchmark federal funds target rate by another quarter of a point, to 6 percent. 

 Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending. He said the recent turmoil in the bond market caused by the gradual reduction in the quantity of Treasury debt was having no effect on the Fed's ability to slow the economy through increases in the short-term rates it controls. And he said he was somewhat worried by the recent sharp rise in oil prices. 

 But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too strong for its own good. 

 The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the labor market, he said, where a rapidly declining pool of jobless workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices. 

 But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market. Buoyant stock prices, he said, were fueling consumer spending and business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the economy was outstripping supply. 

 The only way to resolve that fundamental imbalance, he said, was to sharply curtail the relentless rise in equity prices. 

 Investors in blue chip stock seemed to heed his warning, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down during the day. But as they have repeatedly over the past few years, investors in technology stocks thumbed their noses at Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index up. 

 ``There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably,'' Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to Congress on the economy and monetary policy. 

 But some of the very factors underpinning the nation's remarkable economic performance _ falling joblessness, accelerating productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ ``are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity,'' Greenspan said. 

 The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge in imports, which have made up for the inability of domestic producers to keep up with demand, and by the willingness of people who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job. 

 But those ``safety valves,'' he said, could not contain inflationary pressures forever, especially since the rate increases so far have done little to rein in growth. 

 The Fed's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee ``will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue,'' Greenspan said. ``Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various buffers against inflationary pressures.'' 

 Part of rebalancing the economy, he said, would be limiting or ending the rise in stock prices. 

 ``This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values _ although that, of course, can happen at any time for a number of reasons _ but rather that these values will rise no faster than household incomes,'' Greenspan said.
