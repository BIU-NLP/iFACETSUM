&LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Sweeping economic proposals from Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush _ including two in the past week _ boil down to one thing: what to do with the gigantic federal budget surplus, projected at $4.6 trillion over the next decade. Both candidates have big plans for that surplus, and they would take the country on two very different paths. Both plans carry significant risk. 

 ``The big, big issue is how we're going to use the surplus,'' said David D. Hale, chief economic strategist for Zurich Financial Services in Chicago. ``That's the great defining issue in American politics.'' 

 In a nutshell, Bush would use the bulk of the surplus for an across-the-board tax cut, combined with smaller spending increases. Gore would use the bulk of the surplus for spending increases, combined with smaller, targeted tax cuts. 

 In opposite ways _ Gore with increased spending, Bush with tax cuts _ both would stimulate an economy that many economists believe is already running at full capacity. 

 With the record expansion now in ``uncharted waters,'' said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, ``it's hard to know what we should do at this point, but one could easily see a large expansionary fiscal policy as pushing us into the danger zone where the Fed would start raising interest rates again.'' 

 But because the vast projected surpluses have unleashed political appetites on both sides, many economists believe that it's inevitable the surplus will be used. 

 ``The costs associated with the Bush and Gore plans underscore the likelihood that the days of rapidly growing surpluses are probably soon over,'' said a recent report by the investment bank Goldman Sachs. 

 As for choosing between the Bush and Gore plans, Hale said that ``depends on your politics. If you are concerned about stimulating growth, you favor tax cuts. If you want to redistribute income, you favor public spending.'' 

 Either way, Hale agreed that both risk ``a collision with monetary policy'' by the Federal Reserve, which wants to contain economic growth at a level that keeps inflation low. 

 Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised that the surplus be used to pay down the national debt, rather than to cut taxes or spend more. He has said that using the surplus ``to build up irrevocable spending programs ... is the worst of all circumstances.'' 

 Polls show voters agree with Greenspan on debt reduction. 

 To be sure, both Gore and Bush are calling for a degree of fiscal prudence that once was unimaginable. Both candidates vow to stash the $2.4 trillion of the surplus that is generated by Social Security in a ``lock box,'' where it would help pay down the $5.7 trillion national debt. 

 After that, the two candidates part company. Gore claims his plan would leave a $300 billion cushion and eliminate the national debt by 2012, while Bush's would leave $2.8 trillion of debt. Bush sharply disputes that, claiming that his plan would pay off the debt by 2016 and that Gore's would overspend the surplus. 

 But the fight over arithmetic _ which both sides can easily manipulate _ is far less important than the two strikingly different paths that Bush and Gore recommend for the $2.2 trillion surplus left after Social Security. 

 Gore offers a classic economic populism. 

 ``That's the difference in this election,'' Gore tells crowds. ``They're for the powerful, we're for the people.'' 

 Gore blasts drug companies, HMOs, insurance companies and ``Big Oil,'' promising to side with ``working families'' against ``powerful interests.'' 

 He promises higher Social Security benefits for women and a prescription drug benefit in Medicare. Gore would provide universal health care and preschool for children. He would spend more on teachers, police, environmental protection, medical research and dozens of other programs outlined in his 191-page economic plan, which was issued Wednesday. 

 Gore also offers limited tax cuts targeted at certain groups _ for college tuition, child care, care for elderly parents, fuel-efficient vehicles, after-school programs and many other things. 

 Much of Gore's tax plan _ which the campaign estimates at $480 billion _ would go to giving matching government tax credits, up to $1,500, to lower and middle-income workers who save money in a special retirement account. 

 Taxpayers who fail to meet any of these selected criteria would not see a tax cut, opening Gore to the charge from the Bush campaign that his plan would exclude half of all taxpayers and require the rest to hire an accountant. 

 But Gore has also begun to clothe his populism in the softer fabric of ``fiscal responsibility,'' promising to ``underspend the surplus'' _ a direct response to polls showing voters prefer debt reduction, and an effort to counter Bush's charge that he is a big spender. 

 Bush offers a classic economic conservatism, draped in the softer cloth of social compassion. 

 The basic thrust of the Republican plan is an across-the-board cut in income tax rates, estimated at $1.3 trillion over ten years, that Bush says would return the surplus to taxpayers. 

 ``Some say that the growing the federal surplus means Washington has more money to spend,'' Bush said in his convention speech. ``But they've got it backwards. The surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.'' 

 Bush contends that his tax cut would cut tax rates more for lower-income workers: 100 percent for people earning less than $20,000 and 10 percent for people making more than $100,000. 

 But because people in the top tax brackets pay the great bulk of income taxes, a rate cut is inevitably skewed toward higher-income groups, who would see far more tax relief in dollar terms. 

 The campaign emphasizes that a single mother with one child earning $22,000 would receive a 100 percent tax cut totaling $1,000 and that an average family would see a $1,600 tax cut each year. 

 But the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice says that most of Bush's tax cut would go to households earning $92,500 or more, with an average tax cut of $6,410. 

 This opens Bush to Gore's charge that his plan is ``a massive tax giveaway that primarily benefits the wealthy.'' 

 Bush defends cutting the top tax rate as a way to ``encourage entrepreneurship and growth'' _ the same argument he uses in favoring the repeal of the estate tax. 

 &LR; sh1  &LR; Appeal to the `Investor Class' 

 Bush also aims to appeal to the new ``investor class'' _ the half of U.S. households that now own stocks _ by offering to allow younger workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes. 

 Bush also issued a large Medicare proposal this week, where he would add a prescription drug, remodel the program to provide choice in health plans and increase costs by an estimated $198 billion. 

 While both candidates have tapped economic luminaries for backing _ Gore snagging former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Bush six Nobel-winning economists, including Milton Friedman _ independent analysts voice skepticism. Goldman Sachs economists warned that Bush's tax cut ``could pose a threat to the health of the business expansion, exacerbating pressures on an already tight labor market.'' 

 And they warned that Gore's plan could prove much costlier than he says. As an example, they say Gore has provided no basis for his claim that his retirement savings plan would cost $200 billion. 

 ``In fact, the ongoing cost could be considerably higher,'' Goldman Sachs said _ as much as $1 trillion, enough by itself to wipe out nearly half the surplus. 

 Stephen Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said both candidates would make the surplus vanish. 

 ``If either of these plans comes to pass, the political economy of the 1990s, which helped drive the country's longest period of prosperity, could be turned inside out,'' Roach wrote. ``The era of fiscal restraint would be over. The days of fiscal expansion would be back.''
