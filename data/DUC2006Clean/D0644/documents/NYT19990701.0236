WASHINGTON _ Armed with new forecasts of a growing budget surplus, House Republican leaders unveiled a tax-cut package Thursday that would lower federal income rates across-the-board and give married couples a tax break. 

 ``We will use a major portion of the available surplus to reduce taxes on all Americans, whose income taxes have produced this surplus,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel that writes federal tax laws. 

 While Archer didn't provide specific details, he said the tax cut-package he and his staff are drafting will include: 

 _ A broad-based tax cut that will benefit all federal income tax payers. One proposal includes lowering the 15 percent federal income tax bracket to 13.5 percent. All taxpayers have some income taxed at the 15 percent tax rate so a tax cut in that bracket would benefit everyone. 

 _ A reduction in the so-called marriage penalty created by present law that results in two-income married couples often paying more in federal taxes than if they had remained single. This reflects the fact that the couple's combined income is taxed at a higher rate. 

 _ A cut in capital gains taxes and estate taxes. 

 _ An increase in the current annual $2,000 limit in contributions that can be made to Individual Retirement Accounts. The top limit may be raised to as much as $5,000. 

 _ Allow self-employed people to deduct the cost of health insurance from their federal taxes. 

 The Republican drum beat for tax cuts picked up tempo as the Congressional Budget Office projected the federal budget surplus would total $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. Earlier this week the White House's Office of Management and Budget forecast similar budget surpluses. 

 The goal of Archer and the House Republican leadership to enact a $1 trillion tax cut over 10-years met resistance from the party's moderates in both the House and Senate, not to mention Democrats. 

 Many moderate House Republicans prefer to stick with the smaller $778 billion tax-cut plan over 10 years outlined in the budget plan passed by Congress earlier this year. 

 The smaller tax-cut plan was based on CBO's earlier forecast that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to $1.78 trillion. 

 Budget surplus projections from the CBO and OMB have grown in recent months as the U.S. economy continues to outperform expectations. 

 Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said the $778 billion package is large enough and that the rest of the surplus should go to other government programs like Medicare, veterans health benefits and elementary and secondary schools. 

 Spending for most government programs like education and health care has been frozen or cut as part of a White House and congressional agreement in 1997 to balance the federal budget. But now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased. 

 John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said so many House Republicans have balked at the $1 trillion tax proposal that the leadership may have to stick with the $778 billion plan. 

 Many Democrats and President Clinton think both plans are too expensive. 

 House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the Republican tax cuts plans ``totally irresponsible.'' 

 ``They have really left out important priorities that we ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt said, referring to education and Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly. 

 Gephardt said Democrats favor a less expensive tax cut, similar to the one outlined earlier this year by Clinton. That proposal would cost about $300 billion over 10 years and include such targeted tax cuts as a $500 tax credit for parents who stay at home to care for infants and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent. 

 Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said the Republicans' tax cut plan would take money that could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when the large baby boom generation begins retiring in 2011. 

 Under current projections, Medicare is projected to go broke in 2015 and if nothing is done to Social Security, it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034. 

 Sperling said parts of the Republican plan such as the capital gains tax cut is skewed toward people with higher incomes who can afford to invest in the stock market. 

 ``A tax cut that helps more moderate families is a higher priority,'' he said. ``We have no intention of supporting a new capital gains tax cut.'' 

 Tax cuts are likely to be a continuing topic of discussion between the White House and Capitol Hill this year because lawmakers from both parties say some type of tax cut will likely be approved and signed into law this year. 

 ``There is clearly some momentum building for a middle-income tax cut,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``The fight is becoming not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the dividend.''
