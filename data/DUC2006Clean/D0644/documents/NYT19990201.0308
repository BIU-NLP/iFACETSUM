WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday touted his $1.77 trillion blueprint for federal spending and its bailouts for Social Security and Medicare as relief for Generation X, which faces the risk of high federal taxes to subsidize the retirement of baby boomers. 

 Fleshing out proposals for fiscal 2000 that were sketched in his Jan. 19 State of the Union address, Clinton urged the Republican-led Congress to begin devoting the projected $4.4 trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years to ``progressive but prudent'' investments to enable Americans in their 20s and 30s to meet the ``challenges of their times ... unburdened by the unfinished business of the 20th century.'' 

 Clinton told an invited audience in the East Room of the White House that it is ``profoundly important'' that Americans ``see this budget not just as the budget that saves Social Security and Medicare, but the budget that ensures for young Americans the same chance ... to meet the challenges that they will have to face that we don't know yet.'' 

 Republican leaders in Congress denounced many provisions in the Clinton proposal, saying that the brunt of budget surpluses should be used for tax cuts. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said that ``big government has been reborn and reinvented in this budget.'' 

 Clinton's plan includes $34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $117 billion surplus. He seeks $82 billion in increased taxes over the next five years, including a 55-cent-per-pack increase on cigarettes. 

 The cigarette tax would raise $53.4 billion over five years to help pay the federal government's costs for treating smoking-related illnesses. 

 Clinton described the appeal of his budget proposals to young adults shortly after former White House intern Monica Lewinsky began her sworn testimony before House prosecutors handling the president's impeachment trial in the Senate. 

 Clinton did not mention Lewinsky, 25, by name. But many of the proposals outlined in his budget appeared designed to appeal to the 45 million Americans who were born between 1965 and 1980 _ the so-called Generation X. 

 The Clinton budget would: 

 _ Devote $2.7 trillion, or 62 percent of the projected $4.4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, to rescuing the financially ailing Social Security system. 

 The politically popular retirement program, created in 1935 during the depths of the Great Depression, provides $393 billion to 44 million beneficiaries each year. But the looming retirement of the first of the 76 million post-World War II baby-boom generation in 2011 means that receipts from payroll taxes and interest will begin to fall short of benefit obligations for an expanding elderly population. 

 Clinton said his rescue plan would prolong solvency until 2055. 

 ``If we take care of this, then when the baby boom retires, our children will have their incomes to invest in their lives and the lives of our grandchildren,'' Clinton explained. 

 Clinton faces an uphill political struggle with his proposal to invest about $700 billion of the diverted federal surplus in the stock market to generate additional revenue for Social Security. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have voiced skepticism. 

 _ Ease potential financial burdens on younger Americans by bolstering the Medicare system that provides health care insurance for people age 65 and older. Clinton seeks to set aside 15 percent of the federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, or about $660 billion, to prolong the solvency of the program. 

 Clinton also wants to permit people between ages 55 and 62 to buy into Medicare if they lose health insurance coverage from a private employer, as well as allow anyone between 62 and 65 to buy into the program. 

 _ Boost savings with a proposed Universal Savings Account (USA Account) that would enable employees to contribute pre-tax dollars to a self-directed retirement investment account that would be matched on a sliding scale by the federal government. Clinton wants to devote 11 percent of the projected $4.4 trillion surplus _ or about $500 billion _ to pay the government's share of the program. 

 _ Cut from five to three years the amount of time that an employee needs to become vested in an employer-matching 401(k) program or other retirement plans to help protect younger workers who change jobs frequently. 

 _ Provide a $250 tax credit for parents who stay at home with children under age 1 and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care for dependents with long-term illnesses. 

 _ Seek federal subsidies to underwrite $22 billion in school construction and modernization bonds to ease classroom overcrowding. 

 Clinton said his bid to prolong the solvency of Social Security and Medicare would ease the financial burdens of younger Americans by reducing the burden of financing the nation's $5.5 trillion national debt. 

 The federal government currently pays about $235 billion in interest annually on the debt _ or about 11 cents of every tax dollar. 

 White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget blueprint would cut projected debt costs to just 2 cents out of every federal tax dollar in 2014. 

 Clinton, citing the risk that the global financial crisis might slam into the robust American economy, said reducing the long-term financial burdens facing younger Americans will help bolster the economy. 

 ``This is something we're doing for our kids,'' Clinton said, adding that his plan will ``guarantee them an economy of continuing enduring stability and a hedge against the storms that may happen beyond our borders.'' 

 Clinton's budget proposal offers the nation's 1.4 million armed forces an immediate 4.4 percent pay raise with additional pay hikes over the next five years _ a White House bid to respond to complaints from enlisted personnel between the ages of 18 and 34. 

 The proposal also would allow students and new graduates to deduct interest on student loans for the life of the loan _ typically 10 to 20 years _ rather than only the five years of deductions currently allowed.
