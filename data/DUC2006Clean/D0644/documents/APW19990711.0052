WASHINGTON (AP) -- While tax breaks and many other budget matters are negotiable, President Clinton will veto legislation GOP leaders are promoting that would provide up to $800 billion in tax cuts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Sunday. 

 Summers also indicated strong administration support for Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman whose third four-year term expires in June. But, like former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Summers refused to say whether Clinton would reappoint Greenspan. 

 On taxes, Summers said Clinton would support a $250 billion cut. The GOP alternative, Summers said, would threaten ``the progress we've made toward paying down debt, ... would put at risk core government, everything from the national parks to the FBI to medical research.'' 

 The comments came during Summers' first appearance on the Sunday talk shows since he succeeded Rubin on July 2. 

 Democrats and Republicans agree that reinforcing Social Security and Medicare should be the top priority for most of a projected $2.9 trillion budget surplus over the next 10 years. Those benefit programs are threatened by the aging of the massive post-World War II baby boom generation. 

 The parties cannot agree on how to safeguard the programs and what to do with around $1 trillion that would be left over. 

 Generally, Republicans want to return much of it in lower taxes, which Democrats say would mean tax breaks for the rich. Democrats want to use it for much smaller tax cuts and for more generous upgrades of Medicare and additional spending on such programs as education, which the GOP decries as big-government tax-and-spend policies. 

 Summers was asked on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' whether the GOP plan to use $800 billion over 10 years for tax cuts would be a ``nonstarter'' and vetoed. ``Absolutely,'' he replied. 

 On ABC's ``This Week,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said the latest House proposal, a 10 percent across-the-board tax decrease proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, would cost the government $179 billion more in interest payments than if the surplus were used to pay down the national debt. That would throw the government into deficit and leave no money for shoring up Social Security, Medicare, defense or domestic programs, Podesta said. 

 ``If you look at those proposals, they go into the kind of place in terms of the total cost ... that is exploding, that is on a takeoff path out beyond 10 years, that would threaten all we've worked hard to do in terms of creating budget surpluses and would do a great deal of damage,'' he said. 

 Summers also said such legislation ``would preclude our chance to do something about Social Security and to get those prescription drugs into Medicare.'' 

 On the same program, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he thought Summers' still ``left room for discussion in a number of areas.'' 

 ``I think it's good that the secretary of the Treasury is here talking about what we do with this surplus we now have, and I think that a good portion of it should be returned to the people that are now being overtaxed,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 

 But he added: ``I keep getting mixed signals from the president. I don't know whether he wants to get some things done through cooperation, or whether he's going to go the partisan route, the political route.'' 

 Clinton planned a budget meeting Monday with leaders of both parties. If the president opts for bipartisanship, Lott said, ``We can do it together. ... I hope that he'll approach it that way. Not where can we disagree, but where can we agree.'' 

 The president, Summers said, ``has laid out what are his highest priorities in the tax area, and those are addressing the Social Security and Medicare issues, and then focusing on the needs of the vast majority of American families.'' 

 ``There are other needs and other issues, and certainly we're prepared to talk about things,'' Summers said, ``but the main issue has to be putting our priorities very clear.'' 

 He said the nation's economy is very strong ``because we've been pursuing the right economic strategy ... for the last six years. ... America is back at work.'' 

 The Federal Reserve's Greenspan has been a major figure in establishing those policies. Summers gave him credit. 

 ``Certainly, Chairman Greenspan has done a terrific job, and I have very much enjoyed working with him and look forward to working with him going forward,'' said Summers, who formerly was deputy Treasury secretary. 

 Summers sidestepped a question about whether Clinton might reappoint Greenspan before Greenspan's term ends next year, to ensure that the job does not become a political factor in the 2000 presidential campaign. 

 ``We've got enormous confidence in Chairman Greenspan,'' Summers said. ``Let me leave it at that.''
