WASHINGTON _ They called it the Rosy Scenario, the upbeat economic forecast that President Reagan conjured to show that the nation could afford to cut taxes while building up the military. According to Democrats, the Republican president was cooking the numbers. 

 This week, President Clinton laid out projections of an equally rosy economy, one that can support massive expenditures on Social Security, Medicare, defense, and education. The White House said it is banking on the booming economy to produce budget surpluses over the next 15 years of $4.4 trillion. 

 That is a huge number, greater than the combined value of the French, British, and German economies this year. At its current pace, Ford Motor Co. would need 35 years to sell $4.4 trillion worth of cars. It is enough money to fund the entire federal government for 2 1/2 years. 

 It is also an unrealistic number, say some budget analysts, who believe Clinton has brought his own spin to the old rosy scenario. 

 ``It's something of a fantasy number,'' said Cynthia Latta, chief US economist at Standard & Poor's DRI, a Lexington, Mass. forecasting firm.

 ``Sleight of hand,'' said Stan Collender, who heads the federal budget group at Fleishman-Hillard, a consulting firm. ``This is as close to a budget gimmick as you can get.'' 

 Equally notable to some analysts was that, unlike in Reagan's days, no lawmakers challenged the president on his forecast. Republicans are promoting an income-tax cut as well as more spending for Social Security, and they pretty much signed onto Clinton's numbers, which he released as part of his State of the Union address Tuesday. ``What's really been astounding is how quickly everyone bought into that $4.4 trillion _ both sides, Republican and Democrat,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director for the Concord Coalition, the balanced-budget advocacy group. 

 That suggests that the budget battle this year will focus less on whether big surpluses will actually materialize than on how to spend them. With both parties agreeing to devote most of the surplus to Social Security, their major difference is whether the remainder should go to tax cuts, as Republicans want, or to fixing financial problems in the Medicare health insurance program, a top Clinton priority. 

 Nearly all economists agree that a season of surpluses is at hand, but not all are ready to say the good times will last for 15 years. So far, the White House has not revealed the economic assumptions behind its own predictions. A test of their validity will come Jan. 29, when economists who work for Congress release their next forecast, which could either support or contradict the president's figures. 

 The White House has said that it assumes the economy will grow by slightly more than 2 percent each year, which is well in line with forecasts by private-sector economists. In past years, Clinton has assumed about 2 percent growth while the economy actually grew by better than 3 percent, ``but we continue to use 2 percent to allow for ups and downs in the economy,'' a White House aide said. 

 In taking a mainstream view of economic growth, at least, Clinton's forecast stands in contrast to Reagan's, which were criticized for predicting an outright economic boom. In the most famous ``rosy scenario'' of 1981, for example, Reagan held that his tax cuts would jolt the economy into growth above 4 percent. 

 But several analysts said that Clinton's numbers were still suspect. 

 To begin with, they said, Clinton is likely assuming that he and Congress will resist the temptation to spend most of the surplus, retaining the current caps that limit how much they can spend on various government programs. ``With a budget, it's hard to predict what will happen more than three or four years out,'' Latta said. ``You're going to have a new president, a new Congress, and you don't know what they'll do about taxes and spending. 

 Moreover, relatively little of the surplus will turn up in the early years of the forecast. According to a White House aide, more than half of the total surplus, or $2.3 trillion, would come in the last five years of the 15-year forecast. 

 Budget hawks complain that framing the numbers this way gives Congress license to spend money now that will not arrive until well in the future -- if at all. ``Why don't they use a five-year forecast? Because that doesn't get them the money that they need,'' said Collender. ``Using a 15-year forecast is political accommodation, not economic fact.'' 

 Finally, critics of the Clinton forecast say that long-term projections are unreliable. Until the last few years, Congress most often produced five-year forecasts, Collender said. Even now it usually does not try to look beyond a decade. 

 ``We have enough trouble projecting budget numbers one or two years in advance,'' said Bixby. ``By 15 years out, you're just in fantasy-land.'' 

 Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution, illustrated the uncertainties of long-term budget projections by citing a forecast that congressional economists issued in 1995. 

 Looking ahead one decade, the Congressional Budget Office that year foresaw a federal budget deficit for the year 2005 of over $400 billion. By 1998, the office was predicting a surplus for 2005 of $100 billion -- a swing of a half-trillion dollars for one year alone. 

 Not everyone takes an uncharitable view of Clinton's attempt to draw a long-term view of the economy. After all, the president made his forecast as part of an attempt to shore up Social Security, which faces serious financial problems in 14 years and could become insolvent in 33 years. Social Security's own managers try to plan 75 years into the future. 

 ``There are two things to say these numbers,'' Gary Bass, executive director of the budget watchdog group OMB Watch, said of Clinton's forecast. ``One is, they're never right. The second is, these numbers are as good as any.'' The lack of outcry from Repubicans, he said, shows that Clinton's forecast has more credibility than did Reagan's ``rosy scenario.'' 

 And while Bixby of the Concord Coalition called Clinton's numbers ``overly cheerful,'' he found something in them that even a budget-hawk could love. 

 Clinton would use more than half of the surplus to pay off what the nation owes to future Social Security retirees, reducing federal debt held by the public. ``That part is very fiscally responsible,'' Bixby said.
