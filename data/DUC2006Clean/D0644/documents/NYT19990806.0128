WASHINGTON _ They can't help themselves; it's the nature of the beast. Whether it's Republicans pushing for a big tax cut or Democrats trying to cover the cost of prescription drugs through Medicare, politicians here are drooling over a projected multitrillion-dollar budget surplus and vying over ways to spend it. 

 It was the GOP's turn Thursday, as the House and Senate passed a historic $792 billion 10-year tax cut. President Clinton, with his own plans for the money, promised a veto. 

 But Democrat or Republican, only a few have paused in their reveries to ask: What if the number crunchers are wrong? 

 It is no casual question, for if recent experience is a guide, the 10- and 15-year budget projections on which elected officials are relying could be elusive and ephemeral. 

 ``These future budget surpluses are . . . based on `pie in the sky' projections,'' said Senator Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia. 

 ``I don't think `pie in the sky' is right,'' Byrd said, upon reflection. ``The projections are so far out into the stratosphere _ more than a decade away _ that we would need the Hubble Telescope to track them down.'' 

 Lyndon Johnson. Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan. George Bush. That's just a partial roster of US presidents whose optimistic economic projections ultimately failed to materialize, and so gave them considerable political pain. And none of them ever had the temerity to claim they could see 15 years into the economic future, which Clinton has done. Because of the difficulty of making long-term projections, the House traditionally forecasts spending and tax revenues for no more than five years, the Senate for 10. 

 Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _ $5.9 trillion over the next 15 years by one administration measure _ is the failure of congressional and White House analysts to predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the federal budgets over the last six years. 

 ``The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have been wrong _ horrendously wrong,'' said Stephen Moore, an analyst with the Cato Institute. ``Three years ago they were predicting $100- to $200 billion deficits, instead we got $100- to $200 billion surpluses.'' 

 The OMB at the White House and the CBO on Capitol Hill are the two agencies that most of official Washington relies upon when it comes to predicting budget deficits and surpluses. 

 In 1995 the CBO predicted that the nation would face a $400 billion budget deficit in 2005. Within three years, as the economy continued to exceed expectations, the CBO changed that prediction to a $100 billion surplus: a swing of a half-trillion dollars. A key reason was that the economy grew faster than most economists expected. 

 The list of variables that could eat up a projected surplus is long and multifarious: A recession. A slump in the dollar. A leap in health care costs. A drag in productivity gains. A failure by Congress to respect its current caps on discretionary spending. 

 The current projections are under suspicion for some reasons that are beyond the forecasters' control. No one can claim to know how fast the economy, or the work force, or the cost of living will grow. Moreover, government forecasters must assume that the spending caps will remain in law. 

 ``No one is fiddling with the numbers,'' said Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution who studies government spending policy. CBO and OMB ``are using the methods they've used all along.'' The agencies have never built a deep recession into their forecasts and today's economy gives few reasons to do so, Aaron said. And CBO and OMB ``are duty-bound'' to assume that the existing laws on spending will hold, even if many people believe Congress will change them. 

 Indeed, under the guise of emergency spending, the discretionary budget caps are already eroding. 

 ``Just the other day the House of Representatives determined that the money to pay for the decennial census in the year 2000 required an emergency appropriaton outside of those limits,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York. ``All of a sudden, we have made it into an emergency.'' 

 On Capitol Hill, ``because we have these big surplus projections, people are saying now we can go on another spending spree,'' said Moore. 

 Yet economic ``expansions don't always last forever. Governments tend to go through boom and bust cycles,'' said Moore. ``When there is a boom cycle, like where we are now. . . . The politicians say, `This is going to last forever and we can spend and spend and spend.' And then when the expansion ends we go from 7 percent to 2 percent growth. 

 ``You can make the case these surpluses are a curse because they have been an excuse to break down all semblance of fiscal discipline,'' Moore said. 

 Moore, a libertarian, sides with the House and Senate Republicans who Thursday gave final passage to the sweeping $792 billion tax cut. The GOP plan would be the largest tax cut since 1981, trimming the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent in 2003 and reducing the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005. It would also give two-income couples relief from the ``marriage penalty,'' gradually repeal the federal estate tax and trim the capital gains tax rate for most investors. 

 But Byrd and others think that the inherently risky business of making economic projections is a reason to forestall such a large tax cut. The Clinton administration, which has opposed the size of the tax cut, is exploring the idea of using the surpluses to buy back Treasury securities and thus reduce the $5.5 trillion national debt. 

 During the debate on the tax bill last week, Moynihan charged that the secret strategy of tax-cutting Republicans since the Reagan years has been to use robust budget projections as an excuse to cut taxes _ and thus starve the federal government when the projected revenues don't materialize. 

 A series of ``rosy scenarios,'' issued by OMB during the Reagan administration, resulted in annual deficits of $150 to $200 billion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Moynihan noted. 

 ``Deficits _ that had presumably been the horror of conservative financial thought _ now became something attractive because they could be used to reduce the size of government itself,'' said Moynihan. ``The secret solution was to let the federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving Congress no alternative but to cut domestic programs.'' 

 The GOP is at it again, said Moynihan: ``We are proposing to spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist.'' 

 Tax-cutting Republicans and Democrats, however, argue that their tax cut is but a meager 25 percent of the expected surplus _ leaving plenty of room for error. And Moore and others point out that the projections could just as well be too pessimistic as optimistic. 

 Senator Robert Kerrey, a Democrat from Nebraska, defended the CBO projections when explaining his support for the tax cut. 

 ``The congressional budget office, though they obviously will from time to time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be $3 trillion more coming in over the next 10 years than we have in obligated expenditures,'' said Kerrey. ``I think one would have to imagine some pretty unusual economic circumstances to imagine a downturn in the economy that would eliminate a $3 trillion forecast.''
