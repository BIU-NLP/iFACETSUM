President Clinton touted the new data as "more good economic news," saying it would reduce government interest payments and keep down interest rates. 

 A statement released by the Office of Management and Budget said that the current year surplus would be 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product, "the largest surplus as a share of the economy since 1948." 

 The statement said that the government remains on track for Clinton's plan to eliminate the government's debt held by the public by 2012. 

 It noted that the estimated surplus of at least 230 billion dollars follows a surplus of 124 billion dollars in fiscal 1999 and 69 billion dollars in fiscal 1998. 

 "The last time America had three surpluses in a row was over 50 years ago in 1947-49," the statement said. 

 It is also the first surplus in the federal budget that excludes the big social security and Medicare programs since the medical system was established in 1965, the White House said.
