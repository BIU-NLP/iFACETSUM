WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal treasury posted a surplus of $4.76 billion in July, smaller than June's $56.3 billion surplus but a rare feat since July usually is marked by a budget deficit. 

 The government's surplus last month, announced by the Treasury Department on Friday, compared with a $25.2 billion deficit in July 1999. 

 It was the first time the government posted a surplus in July since the 1950s. 

 The budget is on track to produce a record bounty for the entire fiscal year. 

 Revenue for July totaled $134.1 billion, while expenditures came to $129.3 billion. 

 For the first 10 months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1, the government is running a surplus of $181 billion -- far surpassing the record $124.4 billion surplus for all of fiscal year 1999. 

 Revenue for the first nine months came to $1.67 trillion, while spending totaled $1.49 trillion. 

 With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, it would be the first time the government has reported three consecutive surplus years since 1947, 1948 and 1949. 

 The Clinton administration is predicting a $224 billion surplus for fiscal 2000, while the Congressional Budget Office is projecting a slightly larger $232 billion.
