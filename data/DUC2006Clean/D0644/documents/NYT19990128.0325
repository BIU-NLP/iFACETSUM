WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 -- Several Pennsylvania lawmakers disagreed with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning Thursday that the only way to save Social Security is to raise taxes or cut benefits. 

 Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said there are a host of options for saving the program if all of the federal budget surplus is put toward bolstering Social Security. 

 ``We are projecting a very substantial surplus for many years into the future,'' Specter said. ``It is my thinking that we don't need to have any additional taxes, but can make Social Security sound with that surplus.'' 

 Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that President Clinton's plan to save Social Security is a ``major step in the right direction,'' but tax hikes or benefit cuts are inevitable to make it solvent. 

 White House officials said Greenspan was correct that more work needed to be done to save Social Security, adding that Clinton would be working with Congress. 

 Tax hikes or benefit cuts won't be necessary if Clinton allows for individuals to set up personal investment accounts, said a spokesman for Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``He thinks individuals should invest directly in the stock market instead of the government making those choices,'' Santorum spokesman Robert Traynham said. ``It's Big Brother all over again.'' 

 Greenspan also resurrected concerns he expressed last week about Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the federal budget surplus in the stock market. He said it would be nearly impossible for investments of the money to be protected from political pressures. 

 In his State of the Union address, Clinton said he wants to use 60 percent of the federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up the system that pays benefits to America's retirees. 

 About a quarter of that money would be invested in the stock market. An independent board would make the decisions about investing. Clinton also proposed that 11 percent of the surplus be set aside to create new private retirement accounts with a variety of investment options individuals could choose among. 

 Officials have been grappling with how to prevent Social Security from going bankrupt, which experts say will happen in 2032 unless it is reformed. As early as 2013, the system will be paying out more in benefits to retirees than it takes in from taxes on workers, officials said. 

 Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, said he had serious doubts about investing Social Security dollars in the stock market. 

 ``That's not only risky but President Clinton's plan also raises many difficult questions -- should the government decide which stocks to buy or not buy, when to buy and when to sell, whether to invest in defense companies or tobacco companies or international companies doing business in say, China?'' Murtha said. ``Who's going to make these decisions?'' 

 Specter, Santorum and Murtha said they were pleased that Social Security was at the forefront of the national agenda, because the issue is especially important in Pennsylvania. 

 While 12.6 percent of the nation is 65 years of age or older, Pennsylvania has 15.9 percent, the third highest percentage of elderly people. 

 Census data, which includes Cambria and Somerset counties in the Johnstown regional count, reported that last year 18.7 percent of the population in the Johnstown area is at least 65 years old.
