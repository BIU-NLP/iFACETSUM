WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Franklin Raines said today that the U.S. federal deficit for the fiscal year 1997 will be below 30 billion dollars. 

 Raines made the remarks at a meeting of the U.S. National Association of Manufacturers. It was the latest in a string of estimates in which U.S. government budget analysts have lowered their expectations on the deficit for the fiscal 1997 which ended on September 30. 

 Clinton administration and U.S. Congressional budget officials had said the 1997 deficit would be about 125 billion dollars when the fiscal year started. Just last month, the OMB said it expected a 37 billion-dollar shortfall for fiscal 1997. 

 The U.S. Congressional Budget Office also forecast earlier this month that the deficit would be 23 billion dollars in last fiscal year. 

 The real U.S. federal budget deficit of 1997 will be announced later this month. 

 Raines also said that there was no indication that the U.S. federal budget will be balanced in 1998 and cautioned the U.S. Congress against planning new spending or tax cuts. 

 Both the White House and the U.S. Congress have said that they expected a higher deficit in 1998 than the year of 1997 because of the balanced-budget package which enacted last August. Many of the tax cuts in that agreement take effect this year but few of the spending cuts do.
