WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is forecasting decades of federal budget surpluses, $4.854 trillion worth by 2014 -- precise predictions that come with only one certainty. 

 They will be off the mark. 

 By how much, and whether the projections are too high or too low, depends on the economy, the decisions of at least two future presidents, and what happens during the next seven Congresses. 

 Clinton's 15-year plan forecasts surpluses far exceeding those projected by the administration and Congress 15 months ago. 

 ``The predictions are that for the next quarter century, whatever the ups and downs of the business cycle, the general trend is going to be for surpluses every year for the next 25 years,'' Clinton said. 

 There's no disagreement on the upward trend; the director of the Congressional Budget Office said that only a cataclysmic recession would undo surpluses. 

 But translating trends into numbers stretching 10 and 15 years ahead is educated speculation. The specialists say so. 

 ``There is no way for anyone projecting the economy to be able to say their projections will come true, because chances are they won't,'' said June O'Neill, completing her term as director of the CBO. 

 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said it is impossible to ``confidently project large surpluses'' over the next 15 years, given the uncertainties of budget forecasting. 

 He noted that two years ago, the Office of Management and Budget projected a $121 billion deficit in the 1998 budget, which turned out to be ``a $191 billion error.'' 

 The Congressional Budget Office said that its five-year projections were off by an average of 13 percent annually. At that rate, the CBO could be $250 billion off in 2004, which exceeds the $234 billion surplus it forecasts for that budget year. 

 ``Estimates for more than five years into the future are even more uncertain,'' the CBO report said. 

 The projections have been missing on the down side, first by forecasting deficits, then by minimizing surpluses. The administration forecasts a $79 billion surplus when the current budget year ends on Oct. 1; that is $25 billion more than expected a year ago. The CBO projects a $107 billion surplus this year. 

 The congressional projection is that surpluses will add up to nearly $2.6 trillion over the next decade. Clinton's budget projects the total at about $2.4 billion. 

 ``Our estimates, optimistic as they sound, are more conservative than those of Congress,'' the president said. 

 And longer, by five years, to reach the $4.854 trillion Clinton's budget calls the total reserve by 2014. He wants 62 percent of it, $2.764 trillion, used for Social Security funding, 15 percent for Medicaid needs, 12 percent for a new system of government-aided retirement savings accounts, and 11 percent for ``military readiness and other critical national needs.'' 

 That would be all of it, colliding with Republican plans for tax cuts of up to $800 billion over the next decade. 

 ``The number of proposals to get rid of the surplus almost rivals Mark McGwire's home run record,'' Greenspan said. Not really; that was 70. But it made his point about competing claims for the money. He told the Senate Budget Committee caution should rule, given the uncertainty of long-range forecasts and the difficulty of undoing tax and spending commitments. 

 ``It is not as easy to reduce outlays as it is to increase them, and the reverse is obviously the case in taxes,'' he said. 

 That would be as true of the new retirement accounts Clinton seeks as of the tax cuts Republicans want. 

 It's happened before. Ronald Reagan's 1981 income tax cuts didn't produce the economic surge and increased revenues his administration expected, and deficits increased. A post-Cold War peace dividend was supposed to ease budget pressures a decade ago, but didn't, in part because of economic downturns. 

 As for long-range forecasting, the last major overhaul of Social Security, in 1983, was supposed to keep the system solvent until 2057, but came up 25 years short. 

 Clinton and Republican leaders agree that gap should be closed using the surplus, although they are at odds how to use the funds.
