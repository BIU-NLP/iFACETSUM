WASHINGTON _ A top official in the Clinton administration strongly objected Wednesday to a Republican plan that would allow some money theoretically earmarked for Social Security to be spent for other purposes over the next two years. 

 At the same hearing before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, a senior Democratic congressman worried aloud that President Clinton would lure Democratic lawmakers into taking difficult stands on Social Security and then, as he has on occasion in the past, reverse course and leave his legislative allies stranded politically. 

 The administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the president's chief spokesman on Social Security, said a plan announced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House would make it more difficult to keep the retirement system solvent. 

 Under that plan, Congress could dip into the interest payments the Treasury owes the Social Security reserves for the next two years and use the money for tax cuts or spending on programs like the military and education. After two years, when the operating budget of the government is projected to start running a surplus, no further money collected in Social Security taxes would be used for other purposes. 

 Summers said he had ``very considerable concern'' that the plan would give Congress ``more room for dissipating the surplus.'' 

 By the administration's calculations, the federal budget will have a surplus next year of $117 billion. That will result from the government's collecting $129 billion more in Social Security taxes than it will spend in benefits and a deficit of $12 billion in the operating budget. 

 The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs. But he manages this by proposing tax increases on cigarettes and other budgetary manipulations that Congress has already rejected. 

 In fact, the budgetary dispute between the administration and Congress over how to allocate the Social Security money is a smoke screen to mask the serious political differences over how to strengthen the public retirement system. 

 The president has proposed using 62 percent of the overall budget surplus over the next 15 years _ approximately the portion of the surplus attributable to an excess in payroll taxes over retirement benefits _ to shore up Social Security. Most of this money would be used to pay down the national debt and a small portion would be used by the government to invest in financial markets. 

 Republicans, who have not adopted a specific plan, have agreed that 62 percent of the surplus should be set aside for Social Security. But they want to use the money to enable workers to invest in the stock market in private retirement accounts. 

 The budgetary arguments were briefly overshadowed at Wednesday's hearing by a sharp statement by Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the leading Democrat on the Social Security subcommittee, challenging the president's resolve on Social Security. 

 Matsui, whose wife worked in the White House until recently and who himself is one of the most loyal Clinton supporters in Congress, became frustrated when he could not get Summers to promise that the president would go beyond his general plan and propose specific Social Security legislation. 

 ``I shouldn't be so supportive,'' Matsui snapped, ``lest you pull the rug out from under me.'' 

 Questioned later, Matsui refused to elaborate. But Democratic representatives who spoke only on the condition that they not be identified said Matsui's challenge reflected their concern that the president would cut a deal with Republicans after Democrats had stuck out their necks to support him. 

 In his first budget fight in 1993, Clinton did just that on a fuel tax. Later, in the Democrats' view, the president double-crossed them on welfare changes and the 1997 balanced-budget deal. 

 ``It's all we talk about back there,'' one Democrat said, motioning to a private cloakroom. 

 Another Democrat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, said he had no indication that Clinton would be less than firm on Social Security. But he added, ``I agree there is a credibility problem given past experience.'' 

 Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, there was other wrangling over the budget and Social Security. 

 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, renewed his criticism of Clinton's proposal to allow the government to invest a portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market. Speaking to a subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee, Greenspan argued that state and local government pension funds, because of political meddling, earned lower returns than corporate pension funds. 

 That assertion was challenged Wednesday by the nation's largest public pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System. The fund released a study it had commissioned by Wilshire Associates, a pension-fund consultant, which found that corporate and public pensions funds had earned almost identical rates of return on equities over the past 5 and 10 years.
