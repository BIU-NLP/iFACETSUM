MOSCOW (AP) _ Citing a continued strong job market and a balanced budget, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that despite turmoil in the stock market ``we believe our fundamental economic policy is sound.'' Clinton added his voice to the U.S. administration's efforts to reassure nervous investor after Monday's dramatic declines on Wall Street. Noting that he had consulted with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin during Monday's stock sell-off, Clinton told students at Moscow State University that market gyrations are not unexpected. ``We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound,'' he said, with employment levels at records levels and the U.S. government about to record its first budget surplus in nearly three decades. In a speech focusing broadly on the future of Russia and its quest for democracy and free enterprise, Clinton said the slide in stock prices around the world in recent days was proof that the national economies of the world are more closely linked than ever before. He noted, as an example, that Latin American stocks have been hurt by Japan's economic problems. ``What does that say?'' Clinton asked. ``Whether we like it our not, we are going to be affected by'' the actions of other nations, whether it is Russia, Japan, China or other major powers. While reassuring investors, Clinton and his senior aides were scrambling to keep up with spreading global financial turmoil. Rubin said he spent much of his just-ended vacation on the phone talking about the world economy. ``The world is currently working its way through a difficult period,'' he said Monday. Rubin said he talked Monday with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, stock market regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and finance officials around the world. After the frenzied consultations, Rubin assured Americans, ``The fundamentals of the United States economy are strong. Prospects for growth, low unemployment, low inflation continue to be strong.'' Calls, nevertheless, came from several quarters for action to protect U.S. finances. The National Association of Manufacturers recommended that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to improve other countries' access to American capital, as did Congressman Jim Saxton, chairman of the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Rubin said it was particularly important that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, ``move ahead with actions to put its economy back on track so that it can be a source of strength for the rest of the world.'' He also entreated Republicans in Congress to authorize U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund, which helps support countries in financial trouble.
