WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite unrest by some conservatives, Republicans drove a $1.82 trillion budget for 2001 toward House passage on Thursday, mapping out deeper tax cuts and lower domestic spending than President Clinton wants. 

 Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least $150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $1 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said. It would also leave the door open for creating a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients with a price tag of up to $40 billion. 

 ''If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to support this budget,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, echoing a campaign theme of apparent GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush. 

 In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-Social Security programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to buttress Social Security and Medicare. 

 Likening the Republican budget to a television game show, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., asked, ''Who wants to risk Social Security to give huge tax breaks to multi-multi-multi-millionaires?'' 

 Democrats said the GOP plan embraces spending cuts so severe that Congress would never approve, and they challenged the GOP's numbers, saying the Republican plan would eat into Social Security. 

 Republicans denied that, with Kasich saying that to arrive at that conclusion, Democrats had to ''cook numbers and make things up.'' 

 The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 

 The GOP plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals for defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific programs in later bills. 

 Reiterating administration opposition to the GOP plan, White House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders that it is ''fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable economic plan. In the past, this approach has delayed, rather than expedited, action on'' subsequent budget legislation. 

 Most Republicans supported the proposal. But eight conservatives voted ''no'' on an early procedural vote because they said it lacked controls to ensure that spending remained within budget. 

 ''It means we'll spend $25 billion to $30 billion more than what we say,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the discontented group. ''It's another wink and nod from Washington.'' 

 With the GOP's wafer-thin 11-seat House margin, their defections could jeopardize the budget's final passage. Party leaders labored throughout the day to quell the uprising, and succeeded after promising efforts to prevent spending bills from growing as they move through the Senate. 

 The conservative disaffection was mirrored in the Senate. There, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has yet to even try pushing a similar plan through his panel because conservatives want to hold spending down. 

 At issue was the $596.5 billion the budget would set aside for jet fighters, road building and every other federal function but automatically paid benefits like Medicare and interest on the debt. 

 Of that amount, $307 billion would be for defense, $1 billion more than Clinton's request. Its $289 billion for domestic programs is almost $30 billion below the president's plan. 

 In early votes, the House overwhelmingly rejected five rival budgets by black, progressive and conservative Democrats, Democratic leaders and conservative Republicans.	   As they did when Kasich pushed the plan through his committee last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote on the $483 billion, five-year tax cut Bush has proposed. 

 Bush's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly comparable because they cover different five-year periods. Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses as projected by Congress, and few Republicans would be comfortable voting to do that. 

 Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, nearly offset by $96 billion in higher cigarette and some business taxes. 

 House conservatives won a promise from GOP leaders to pursue at least $4 billion more in debt reduction this year. 

 In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have prohibited spending any of this year's projected $27 billion surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate $9 billion measure financing anti-drug efforts in Colombia, U.S. troops in Kosovo, and aid to victims of Hurricane Floyd and other domestic disasters.
