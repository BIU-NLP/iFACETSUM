AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has presided over more executions than any governor in modern American history, said on Friday that he favors DNA testing on condemned inmates to ``erase all doubts'' that an innocent person might be put to death. 

 Lawyers who defend Death Row inmates called Bush's remark ``encouraging,'' but questioned why the governor has not pushed for a law requiring DNA testing in the state that leads the nation in executions. 

 ``Not only should they be doing DNA testing for Death Row inmates, but for all inmates where the science could prove guilt or innocence,'' said Barry Scheck, who gained national prominence as part of O.J. Simpson's legal defense team. 

 ``The technology is such where we now have this magic bullet of truth and we should be using it in every case where it would make a difference,'' Scheck said. 

 Scheck is working with Austin lawyer Maurie Levin on behalf of Texas Death Row inmate Ricky McGinn, whose execution is scheduled for June 1. The lawyers filed a petition on Friday with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on McGinn's behalf that DNA testing be used in his case. 

 McGinn was convicted of raping and killing a 12-year-old girl in Brown County in Central Texas. He has denied committing the crimes, and his lawyers say DNA testing on the hair and body fluid samples found at the crime scene are essential to settle any doubt in the case. 

 McGinn had been scheduled for execution on April 27. But Fort Worth lawyer Richard Alley, who was handling his case at the time, won a stay because the March 28 tornado that ravaged the city destroyed his office _ including papers relevant to his client's case. 

 Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, made the DNA remark during a teleconference from Austin with a Catholic journalists organization meeting in Baltimore. 

 The governor did not waver from his strong support for the death penalty, which has been carried out 217 times in Texas, 130 of those during his 51/2-year tenure. And he reiterated his long-held assertion that none of those sent to Huntsville's death chamber were innocent. 

 ``I don't believe we've executed a single innocent person,'' Bush said told The Associated Press. ``If the DNA testing helps to settle a case, or erase any doubts or concerns, we would support that.'' 

 The death penalty has become a key issue in Bush's run for the presidency, not only because of the pace of executions in Texas. Earlier this year, Republican Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on execution once evidence emerged raising doubt on the guilt of 13 inmates awaiting the death penalty in that state. 

 Texas executed 35 inmates last year, the most in the nation, and this year is ahead of that pace, with 18 so far. The state set a record with 37 executions in 1997. Bush has spared only one condemned inmate since becoming governor in 1995. 

 He has rejected appeals from U.S. religious leaders, the Vatican and the European Parliament in several death penalty cases, including that of Karla Faye Tucker, the Houston pickax killer who had professed to having become a born-again Christian in prison. 

 Texas law limits the governor's power in capital cases. A governor may commute a death sentence or grant clemency only upon the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. 

 A governor on his own may grant a one-time, 30-day stay of execution to allow a condemned inmate more time to pursue court appeals. 

 Although Bush has been reluctant to intervene in death penalty cases, he has issued pardons to two inmates sentenced on sexual assault charges because DNA tests showed that the men were not guilty. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) nn
