AUSTIN, Texas _ Knocked by death penalty protesters while on the presidential campaign trail, Texas Gov. George W. Bush isn't likely to lose votes because of his support of the death penalty, political analysts say. 

 ``This is not a burning issue. It's momentarily an issue because the media doesn't have anything else to talk about,'' said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the University of California at Irvine. 

 Speaking from a state where Bush is fighting hard against Democratic Vice President Al Gore, Petracca predicted the Gary Graham story would disappear from newspapers' front pages with ``the first airplane tragedy of the summer or boating tragedy or celebrity killed or celebrity divorced.'' 

 ``Bush has got the standard right line here, which is, `I'm following the law,''' he said. 

 Graham was executed in Hunstville, Texas, Thursday night amid a clamor of protests that he was innocent of the 1981 murder he was convicted of committing in Houston. 

 Political experts predicted little or no backlash for Bush as long as he appears to be handling the issue consistently and seriously. 

 ``Politically, it's a wash,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. ``I don't see it doing him any great harm or any particular good, although it could reinforce his image for decisively standing firm under pressure.'' 

 Bush will face 14 more executions in the state before Election Day. 

 The death penalty won't be a factor with ``the overwhelming majority of Americans who are in favor of capital punishment,'' said Matthew Felling of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs, which does content analyses of news and entertainment media. 

 Gore also is a death-penalty supporter, Felling noted. 

 The worst damage done to Bush over the death penalty came after he was reported to have spoken in a mocking way about murderer and born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker's plea to live, Felling and others said. 

 A Bush spokeswoman has said Bush's demeanor was misinterpreted and that he took the Tucker case seriously. 

 ``I think he really understands now he cannot appear to be taking that issue lightly,'' said Allan Saxe, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington. ``The issue of leadership and seriousness is very important.'' 

 Questions have been raised nationally about the general quality of legal representation at trial for Texans given the death penalty. 

 A number of Texas officials, including Attorney General John Cornyn, have defended the state's process as fair. 

 Some of the state's Democratic U.S. representatives have urged Bush to place a moratorium on executions until a study can be done of capital punishment here. 

 The governor of Illinois has done so in his state. 

 But Bush's office said he doesn't have the authority to independently change death sentences or stop executions. 

 He only can grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve unless his appointed Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends otherwise. 

 Bush recently did this for the first time in a case involving DNA testing. 

 In the latest case to draw high-profile attention, that of Graham, who was defended by such well-known figures as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, officials said Bush couldn't even grant a reprieve without board action. 

 That's because former Gov. Ann Richards previously had granted Graham an independent reprieve. 

 ``This does highlight the weakness of the gubernatorial office in Texas,'' said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department of politics and international relations at Drake University in Des Moines. 

 ``For all that Bush talks about leadership, the governor's office in Texas, relative to that in other states, is fairly weak,'' he said. 

 But Goldford said at worst the Texas death penalty issue at this point is only ``slightly negative'' for Bush. 

 ``It puts him on the defensive a little bit,'' he said. ``Bush has been setting the agenda of the campaign so far, and Gore has been responding to Bush. This doesn't knock Bush off stride. It slows down his offense.''
