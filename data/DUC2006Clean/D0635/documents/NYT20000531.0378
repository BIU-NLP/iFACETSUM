Unlike past death penalty cases, where Bush waited until all appeals has been exhausted before indicating how he was leaning, he made his comments Wednesday ahead of an anticipated court ruling in the case. 

 Bush aides said Wednesday that they did recognize that this case was one of the more attention-getting death penalty cases, but they insisted that such factors have no bearing on how Bush acts or on what he says. Yet the case also affords Bush a chance to speak in a moderate voice on the death penalty without seeming to pander, because the case involves some understandable questions of evidence that have drawn national attention. 

 One aide noted that this case, like that of Henry Lee Lucas, involves a question of evidence, and the aide suggested that Bush finds this sort of factor more relevant and compelling than sentimental, emotional factors such as those involved with the decision not to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker. In other words, this case, like that of Lucas, has questions that go directly to the matter of guilt, not of contrition. 

 Tucker, a born-again Christian who said she had repented for her crimes and whose case drew pleas from religious leaders, was executed in 1998. Bush commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison in 1998, following a recommendation by the state pardons board, after serious questions were raised about whether Lucas committed the murder he was convicted of. 

 Bush's embrace of DNA testing for death row inmates, which he never advocated in Texas, comes as some parts of the nation have seen a rethinking of capital punishment amid concerns about the execution of innocent prisoners and polls that indicate support for the death penalty is at a 20-year low, although most Americans still favor it. 

 Earlier this year, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on capital punishment there after the exoneration of 13 men on death row, and he said last month that executions will not resume until he has a ``100 percent guarantee'' that no innocent person will face the death penalty again. Across the nation, bills have been introduced in a dozen states to halt executions. And in New Hampshire, state lawmakers in May became the first to vote to abolish the death penalty since the Supreme Court allowed executions to resume in 1976. The New Hampshire governor, Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, has vetoed the measure. 

 In addition to its appeal before the federal appeals court, McGinn's defense team, which includes Barry Scheck, the DNA expert and New York lawyer who helped defend O.J. Simpson, has filed a civil lawsuit in Texas to obtain the hair and semen samples taken from the victim's body so they can be retested. 

 Should DNA tests indicate that the hair and semen did not come from McGinn, that would ``raise doubts about whether he could have committed the whole crime,'' said Scheck, who added that he has ``no idea'' about the guilt or innocence of McGinn. Only two states, New York and Illinois, allow condemned prisoners to get new DNA tests of evidence in their cases, and Scheck said Congress should pass a bill making that standard across the nation. 

 Lee Haney, who prosecuted the murder case in 1993, said ``as far as humanly possible'' he is convinced of McGinn's guilt. If new DNA tests indicated the hair and semen were not from McGinn, he said, ``It would obviously lead to the conclusion that someone else was involved in the sexual assault in addition to McGinn, but it would not affect other evidence in case that very clearly ties him to the murder.'' That includes blood from the victim in McGinn's car and on his clothes, he said. 

 Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of some of McGinn's legal representation. A defense team investigator in the case, Tina Church, told the Dallas Morning News that McGinn's appellate lawyer, Richard Alley, did not know about the inconclusive DNA tests until a few months ago, when she brought them to his attention. `He should have known about the tests,' Church told the newspaper. 

 Alley, of Fort Worth, Texas, has twice been publicly reprimanded by the State Bar of Texas _ once in 1985, the other time in 1992 _ and there are two private complaints pending against him, according to state bar officials. Alley said neither pending complaint concerns the McGinn case, and he said he would have liked to have brought the motion for DNA retesting more quickly, but that it took time to obtain the necessary affidavit from a scientific expert.
