WASHINGTON _ Convicted murderer Gary Graham, set to be executed today in Huntsville, is hitting Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign with its greatest challenge since Arizona Sen. John McCain put up a dramatic primary fight. 

 ``Every campaign is faced with a major issue, either planned or unplanned, and it appears that Bush is being faced with his first major issue with this death penalty controversy,'' said Scott Reed, former campaign manager of Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid. ``How he handles this will be one of the three or four deciding factors on election day. I put it up there with the vice-presidential selection, the convention and the debates, big events that affect the way the world looks at the candidate.'' 

 Bush told CNN Wednesday that he would, ``uphold the laws of the land and if it costs me politically, it costs me politically.'' But with the world watching, the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, all Bush appointees, have taken the unusual step of delaying a decision on Graham's fate until noon today. 

 Under Texas law, Bush can accept or veto board recommendations to pardon Graham or commute his sentence. He cannot spare Graham's life against the board's wishes because former Gov. Ann Richards already did that in Graham's case in 1993. The board has recommended a death sentence be commuted to life in prison only once and Bush accepted that recommendation. 

 Graham's conviction, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, has been grabbing media attention for the past several week. It has been driven by newspaper reports questioning the fairness of Texas' justice system; reports of innocent men set free thanks to DNA testing; and a Columbia University study that found two-thirds of death sentences in the past 23 years have been overturned on appeal. 

 In addition, the Rev. Pat Robertson and conservative columnist George Will have called for a reassessment of the death penalty. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and human rights activist Bianca Jagger joined protestors in Austin to support Graham as death penalty opponents heckled Bush on the stump. 

 Nationally, death penalty support, still strong, has softened since 1980. Texans, however, continue to firmly back the ultimate punishment, despite concerns that the state has executed innocent people and expressions of strong support by Texans for making DNA testing available to inmates, according to a Scripps Howard Texas poll released today. 

 The survey of 1,000 Texans, conducted May 22-June 16, showed 73 percent in favor of the death penalty, consistent with national polls. Seventy-two percent still favored it even when presented with true life imprisonment as an alternative. But 57 percent also said they believe that Texas has executed innocent inmates. Thirty-eight percent said that the state's image benefits from its frequent use of capital punishment. Texas leads the nation in executions. 

 ``What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who think Texas has executed innocent people,'' said poll director Ty Meighan. ``I think that's more a criticism of the criminal justice system. Perhaps people think that some of these inmates are not getting a fair trial or they don't have the proper legal representation.'' 

 Seventy-six percent of the respondents said Texas should declare a moratorium on death sentences for inmates whose cases might be affected by DNA testing. Eighty-seven percent said the testing should be available to inmates at no charge. 

 Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said Bush weakens his credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his watch have been guilty. He said Vice President Gore, a death penalty supporter, has nothing to gain by speaking out. 

 But in one of his few statements on the issue, Gore said Wednesday that a moratorium on executions is the right thing for states with numerous criminal justice errors. He said he did not know the record in Texas, pointing instead to Illinois. 

 ``This is really a situation, to use the metaphor, of Bush hanging himself,'' Mellman said. ``The reality is the public still supports the death penalty, but the level of support is shrinking and shrinking fairly dramatically...Given what's happened in science and what's been revealed in these studies of the death penalty, for anybody to say they're 100 percent sure that everyone put to death has been guilty is ignorant.'' 

 Republican Illinois Gov. George Ryan suspended executions after 13 death row inmates were exonerated and released. Recently, Bush granted his first-ever 30-day reprieve so that the inmate, Ricky McGinn, could get further DNA testing. 

 Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas law professor, said what Bush does today and later matters less in political terms than how he does it. 

 ``This has not to do with Bush's chances to win the presidency so much as it is another opportunity for him to show whether or not he can seem brave and serious enough when he talks about these matters,'' Buchanan said. This is particularly true since this issue will not fade away for Bush: at least 16 Texas inmates are scheduled to be executed by the November election. 

 Last year, conservative writer Tucker Carlson quoted Bush mocking Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the Civil War, who was convicted of the ax-killing of two people. Tucker, a white woman who never contested her guilt, asked to be spared because she found religion and redemption on death row. 

 Graham, a black man with a string of crimes behind him, does not pose the same sort of public relations problem. Houston police accused him of 22 crimes. He pleaded guilty to 10 armed robberies. Victim David Spiers was left unable to walk for two years after Graham shot him during a robbery. A female victim who was 57 in 1981 was robbed, abducted, and repeatedly raped by Graham. 

 Today, the ninth-grade dropout's fate hangs on his conviction in the murder of Bobby Lambert, shot in 1981 as he walked outside a Safeway, groceries in his arms. As he weighs the facts, Bush needs to show the world his heart, Buchanan said. 

 ``He's not comfortable talking about his serious, inner processes publicly so he sticks to a script,'' he said. ``In certain instances that won't reflect well on him.'' 

 Gov. George W. Bush's options in Gary Graham's execution: 

 He cannot issue a 30-day reprieve. Graham received the one reprieve he is allowed by law from Gov. Ann Richards in 1993. 

 He cannot halt the execution unless the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life sentence, or a pardon. 

 He cannot overrule a board vote to proceed with the execution. 

 He can veto a board vote to grant a reprieve, commutation, or pardon _ and order the execution to proceed.
