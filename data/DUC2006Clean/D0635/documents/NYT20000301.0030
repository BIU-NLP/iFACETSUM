(UNDATED) _ It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty in America. 

 Last week, they took an old woman in Texas from her cell on a gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in Europe _ were agitated. 

 It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God. 

 And it doesn't do any good. They don't take much notice of what the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over here. There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment. 

 In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor George W. Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems to so enjoy its executions. After all, the man was obeying the laws of Texas, which were made before he entered government. 

 He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas. Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think about it. 

 Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home. And there isn't much doubt that Mrs. Beets was guilty of the crime she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America. 

 Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by killing an old woman. 

 It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing anyway. 

 The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades ago. It's as well to be clear about why it is so. The taking of life itself is not always wrong, after all. 

 We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend ourselves, for instance. And we expect others to do it on our behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to achieve some greater good. 

 But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal. Anything else is lynching. 

 The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings. 

 The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill. It is a commandment. It really is set in stone, and you had better have some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it. 

 There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops killing. In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining again. 

 There is no statistical relationship. Any consideration of the rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what is at stake here is simple retribution. 

 But then there is no consideration. Indeed the legal process permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking. 

 Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course. But it has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the legal slums. 

 Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk. 

 Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the death penalty. Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have drawn interest. 

 More than 600 people have died. How many of them were innocent? Now that they are dead, will we ever know? 

 This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism. 

 Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words that have been frequently quoted since. 

 ``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, ``don't kill me.'' 

 I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't blame him for the explosion of state killing. The point is that for governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a life has become just too easy. 

 They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper come across their desks. No one in high office questions it: that would be too hard. 

 One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however. Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had ended with the conviction overturned. 

 There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it is growing in intensity. 

 So that's the argument; it's over now. Betty Lou Beets is dead. 

 But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month. 

 There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country. And America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy. &QL; &UR; ___________________ &LR;  &QC; &UR; (To publish this excellent 1,000-word article from THE INDEPENDENT newspaper in London, it must be purchased from the New York Times Syndicate's sales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at 732-390-4697.
