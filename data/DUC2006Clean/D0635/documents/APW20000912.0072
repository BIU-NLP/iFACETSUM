AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush gets criticized for his hands-off approach to state executions, but state law leaves little room for governors to act in these life-and-death decisions. 

 Supporters say Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, allows the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship. 

 ''The governor leaves it up to each parole board member to make their own decisions after they review the case. They're an independent body,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones. 

 Others contend that Bush does direct the board -- through his public statements on executions and his power to appoint members to their six-year, $80,000-per-year jobs. 

 All current board members are Bush appointees. 

 ''It does seem that they would want to be in line with his way of thinking about it,'' said Richard C. Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. 

 Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration. 

 But David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who represents condemned inmates, suggests both Bush and his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, have used the parole board ''as an excuse to avoid having to make a tough, moral decision.'' 

 In Texas, the governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon. Those limits evolved from a pardons scandal in the 1920s and are aimed at preventing a governor from granting continuous reprieves. 

 Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed 143 people, including 32 this year. Texas has executed 231 people in the past two decades, the most in the nation. 

 Three more executions are scheduled before the Nov. 7 presidential election, including that of high-profile inmate Ricky Nolen McGinn on Sept. 27. 

 Bush granted a 30-day reprieve for McGinn in June -- the only reprieve he has granted as governor -- so that further DNA testing could be done. But the tests failed to clear McGinn in the rape and murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter. 

 Bush never has witnessed an execution. For the most part, he limits his role to privately quizzing his attorneys about cases, aides say. 

 Unlike Richards, who met with her general counsel about executions, Bush has met with the staff lawyers who studied condemned inmates' cases, said Jim Sallans, a former staff attorney who reviewed death row cases for both governors. Sallans left after Bush's first term. 

 Bush would read the lawyer's memo -- about three to four pages -- and talk with the attorney, usually from 15 minutes to 45 minutes but perhaps up to two hours, Sallans said. 

 Ultimately, Sallans said, Bush would ask: ''OK, Did he do it? Did he get a fair trial?'' 

 Bush did not try to instruct the board how to vote, he said. 

 ''That's political suicide,'' Sallans said. 

 Gerald Garrett, the board chairman, said Bush takes a hands-off approach with members, telling them, ''in essence, make the right decision and if there is political fallout, so be it.'' 

 The Texas governor does not have the power to declare a moratorium on executions, as Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, has done. 

 But some suggest Bush, if concerned about the fairness of Texas' death penalty, could use his power of persuasion to generate public support for a moratorium. 

 ''He could have a much higher profile in the Texas death penalty debate, if he wanted to,'' said Dow, the professor who has represented inmates. 

 Dow also contends that governors can communicate with the parole board as much as they wish, through direct dialogue or public statements. 

 Case in point: Henry Lee Lucas. 

 Bush asked the parole board to investigate the conviction of Lucas, a drifter sentenced to death for the murder of an unidentified woman known as ''Orange Socks.'' 

 The parole board recommended commuting Lucas' sentence to life in prison, and Bush approved it in June 1998. 

 The case of Karla Faye Tucker -- a pickax murderer, a Christian convert and the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War era -- was more clear-cut for Bush. 

 ''I told him that's an easy one,'' Sallans recalls. ''She did it, she confessed to it, she got a very fair trial.'' 

 Tucker was executed in February 1998. 

 As for Graham, Bush maintained his public silence about the case until the end, despite being dogged about it on the campaign trail. Graham maintained his innocence in the murder of a man during a 1981 holdup. 

 In the end, Bush said he agreed with the parole board's vote in favor of Graham's execution. 

 ''After considering all the facts,'' he said, ''I am confident justice is being done.''
