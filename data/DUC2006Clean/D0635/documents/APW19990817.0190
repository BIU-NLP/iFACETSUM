HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- In a case that death penalty opponents portrayed as a test of Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' an appeals court blocked a mentally ill killer's execution Tuesday just four hours before he was to die. 

 The Republican presidential candidate had said he was unlikely to postpone the execution of Larry Robison, who killed five people, including an 11-year-old boy and a lover who was beheaded, stabbed 49 times and sexually mutilated. 

 Robison, 42, said recently he was ``like a little kid at Christmas'' looking forward to his lethal injection. His lawyers, relatives and capital-punishment opponents contended he was mentally ill and deserved treatment rather than death. 

 In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, blocked Robison's execution and sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the trial court. State and federal courts had rejected other appeals challenging Robison's competency. 

 The decision effectively put the execution off for weeks, if not months. Prosecutors said Robison will be examined by psychiatrists selected by his attorneys and state lawyers and the findings will be presented to a trial judge in Fort Worth, who then will rule on the prisoner's competence. 

 Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general, said it was unclear whether the state could or would appeal the decision. 

 The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people could be executed as long as they understood the punishment and why they were getting it. In a concurring opinion to Tuesday's order, Judge Tom Price wrote that because Robison ``has long suffered from schizophrenia, he does not understand the nature of the punishment to be imposed upon him.'' 

 The decision at least temporarily kept Bush from having to address calls from capital punishment opponents who demanded the governor, who has defined himself as a ``compassionate conservative,'' give Robison a 30-day reprieve. 

 ``We believe that the citizens of your state and now all American voters are entitled to know just how real and deep your sense of `compassion' reaches,'' death penalty opponent William B. Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, wrote in a letter. 

 Bush, who was criticized for mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker in a recent interview published in Talk magazine, has never issued a reprieve in nearly five years as governor -- a span that has seen 98 executions in Texas. 

 Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0 against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life. That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day reprieve to allow him more time to appeal. 

 Bush, however, indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's execution. He had no immediate comment after the court ruling Tuesday. 

 Bill Clinton found himself in a similar situation just weeks before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when as governor of Arkansas he allowed a brain-damaged cop killer to be executed. At the time, some political observers said Clinton's decision to deny the man clemency helped him distance himself from the Democrats' liberal, soft-on-crime image. 

 Robison, a former construction worker, was to be the fifth Texas inmate to receive lethal injection this month and the 21st this year. Another execution is set for Wednesday evening. 

 ``I feel like a little kid at Christmas waiting for Santa Claus to come,'' Robison said in a recent interview. ``I don't believe in death. I'm just leaving this vehicle behind. I'm moving on to new territory.'' 

 Robison admitted he killed five people in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth in 1982. One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, decapitated, slashed eight times and stabbed. Robison said he ate the man's testicles. 

 His case was considered by many critics an example of the problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill. Before the killings, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, but he was not considered violent and had been released from several public hospitals. 

 He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
