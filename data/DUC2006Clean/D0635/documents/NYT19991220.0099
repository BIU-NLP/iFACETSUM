AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush is proud to call himself ``the law-and-order governor.'' And rightly so. In five years in office, he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates, more than any other governor in any state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. 

 But the relentless efficiency of his state's death row machinery is about to intersect, vividly, with Bush's pursuit of his party's presidential nomination. In the five weeks before the Iowa and New Hampshire presidential contests, Texas is scheduled to execute eight more people, among them convicts whose cases put the debate about the death penalty into high relief. 

 Two of the eight committed their crimes as juveniles. One claims to have been convicted on the basis of a faulty DNA test. One is a paranoid schizophrenic whose condition went untreated _ until he killed. 

 And then there's Johnny Paul Penry. 

 Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the Penry case. There is no excusing his heinous crime: In 1979, while on parole for a previous rape conviction, he broke into the home of Pamela Carpenter, raped her, and then stabbed her to death with the scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece. 

 But Penry has the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old. He never got past the first grade and spent his childhood years in and out of mental institutions. Court records describe how his mother beat him as a baby and dipped him in scalding water. She forced him to eat his bodily wastes, according to those records. 

 Penry's execution is sure to gain national attention, for it was in his case in 1989 that the US Supreme Court issued a controversial ruling that the death penalty for retarded individuals is not a constitutionally prohibited ``cruel and unusual punishment.'' He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Jan. 13. 

 Bush has not spoken publicly about the Penry case and, in keeping with his normal practice, he would not examine the facts of the case until the date set for execution. Bush has never granted such a reprieve. And it was the governor's opposition last spring that led to the scuttling of a bill that passed one house of the Texas Legislature. It would have banned executions of the mentally retarded. 

 The case of another Texas convict, Larry Robison, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, poses another issue: whether the mentally ill should be executed. In a bloody rampage, Robison slaughtered two men, two women, and an 11-year-old boy near Fort Worth in 1982. 

 Before he launched his murderous spree by decapitating and sexually mutilating his male housemate, Robison had no history of violence. His illness had been diagnosed when he was 21, but he was turned away from treatment because he lacked health insurance. He has requested Jan. 21 as an execution date, because he wants to die on a night of a full moon. 

 The scheduled executions of Glen McGinnis (Jan. 25) and Anzel Jones (Jan. 26) and David Hicks (Jan. 20) offer other windows onto the death penalty and how determinedly Texas and Bush enforce it. McGinnis and Jones were both juveniles, 17 years old, when they committed their brutal crimes. Hicks, meanwhile, claims that faulty DNA analysis helped convict him of a crime he did not commit _ the rape and murder of his grandmother. 

 The death penalty has not yet emerged as a campaign issue in a nation where roughly two of three voters, and three of four Republicans, endorse the practice. Here in Texas, the most prominent victims' rights organization speaks for many when giving Bush its whole-hearted support. 

 ``Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice,'' said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, the Houston-based victims group. ``There is poll after poll that proves the citizens of Texas support the death penalty, the ultimate punishment.'' 

 Clements defends the use of the death penalty, even in those cases where the offender was 17 at the time of the crime, or mentally disabled. ``If they are competent to be convicted, then so be it,'' she said. 

 But death penalty opponents contend that Bush's record-setting embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him in the 2000 election. He shows a callousness, they say, toward the solemn issues that arise from government's ultimate power: taking the life of its citizens. 

 Beyond the overall support given to capital punishment in the polls, ``the realization is growing that the death penalty, like a lot of other things that government does, has serious problems,'' said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. 

 ``People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to be concerned about executing the mentally retarded, or those who had poor legal representation,'' said Bright. ``If you are going to be executing those who were children when they committed the crime, or people who are mentally ill, the governor ought to at least be engaged. You don't get the sense that Bush is engaged at all.'' 

 Bush reinforced such doubts when, in a magazine interview last summer, he mocked the eleventh-hour plea for mercy by a convicted double murderer, Karla Faye Tucker, imitating her by whimpering ``Please, don't kill me'' with pursed lips. 

 Tucker, whose born-again faith and repentance for her crimes was cited in requests for mercy made to Bush by such figures as Pope John Paul II and televangelist Pat Robertson, was the first woman to be executed by the state of Texas since the Civil War. 

 And in a recent case that spurred headlines across the country, Texas authorities used an airplane and a team of medical attendants to fly David Long from the intensive care ward of a Galveston hospital to the death chamber in Huntsville on Dec. 8 so he could be executed on his appointed date. He had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs. 

 ``Putting him on life support and flying him out of the hospital so they can kill him? People are asking, `What the hell are they doing down there?' '' said George Kendall, who heads the NAACP's death penalty project in New York. ``There is a growing volume of cases in Texas that make it sound like however the system is supposed to work, this is not it.'' 

 At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national movement for a moratorium on capital punishment, and led to a slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion polls, foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on behalf of those scheduled to die. 

 Bush's legislative record raises further issues. Despite repeated judicial criticism of the way that Texas provides legal services to indigent defendants in capital punishment and other criminal cases _ via a court-appointed patronage system _ Bush vetoed a bill that would have reformed the system and established an independent public defender's office this year. 

 In a chapter on the death penalty in his campaign autobiography, Bush says that he treats his ``profound'' responsibility in capital punishment cases ``thoughtfully and carefully,'' but that he limits his decisions on whether to intervene to two matters: ``Is there any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence? And, have the courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case?'' 

 As a matter of political philosophy, Bush says, he does not believe he has the right to ``replace the verdict of a jury with my own'' in order to show mercy, or for potentially mitigating factors like age, mental illness, or mental retardation.
