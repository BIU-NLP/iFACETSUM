HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The Texas parole board refused to block the execution Thursday of Gary Graham in the most contentious death penalty case to confront Gov. George W. Bush since he announced his run for the White House. But several last-minute court appeals delayed the execution. 

 Late appeals failed in the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote and in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Graham's attorneys then tried to win a civil action challenging the constitutionality of the Texas clemency process; a federal judge ruled he did not have jurisdiction. 

 Appeals courts had already rejected Graham's arguments that he was convicted on shaky evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a poor job. 

 Bush said he supported the parole board's decision and pointed out that Graham's case had been reviewed more than 20 times by state and federal courts. 

 ''After considering all of the facts I am convinced justice is being done,'' Bush said after the appeals were denied. ''May God bless the victim, the family of the victim, and may God bless Mr. Graham.'' 

 Graham, 36, was convicted of killing a man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket one night in 1981. He pleaded guilty to 10 robberies around the same time but said he was innocent of the murder. 

 ''Because of human error and human frailty, we are about to put to death a man who is innocent,'' said Richard Burr, another of Graham's attorneys. 

 The Bush-appointed parole board, which has spared a prisoner only once during the Republican's tenure, could have granted a 120-day reprieve, a commutation to a lesser sentence, or a conditional pardon. 

 ''I can say, unequivocally, that the board's decision not to recommend clemency was reached after a complete and unbiased review of the petition and evidence submitted,'' board chairman Gerald Garrett said, hours before the execution was to take place. 

 Immediately after the vote was announced, protesters outside the prison in Huntsville began chanting: ''Murderers, murderers.'' A woman who claimed to be Graham's daughter sobbed in the arms of a friend. 

 Hundreds of officers outnumbered protesters -- most of them supporters of Graham -- who gathered in stifling heat and humidity near the brick prison where 221 executions have been carried out since capital punishment resumed in Texas in 1982. The total is by far the highest in the nation. 

 Graham had vowed to ''fight like hell'' on the trip to the death chamber. 

 In the hours leading up to the execution, he refused meals but met for about an hour with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whom he designated his spiritual adviser, his stepmother and Bianca Jagger of Amnesty International. Jackson said he and Graham talked and prayed. 

 ''He was amazingly upbeat,'' Jackson said. ''There were no tears shed. He had a sense of inner peace. He feels he was being used as a kind of change agent to expose the system. With every passing hour ... there is mass education around the world about what is happening in Texas.'' 

 Graham resisted when he was moved late Wednesday from death row to the death house in downtown Huntsville. Several officers had to hold Graham down to apply the restraints, said Larry Fitzgerald, Department of Criminal Justice spokesman. 

 Bush had no authority to halt the execution without a majority vote from the 18-member parole board. The governor does have the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve in death penalty cases, but Graham had already received one in 1993 from Bush's predecessor. 

 Bush had said he would treat the case no differently than any other he has considered. During the governor's 5&frac12; years in office, 132 men and two women were executed before Graham.

 Two years ago, Bush told the parole board to review the case of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas because of questions about Lucas's conviction. His death sentence eventually was commuted to life. This month, Bush granted a condemned man a 30-day reprieve so that he could pursue DNA tests. The governor sent no similar messages about Graham's case. 

 The debate over Graham's case came amid growing questions about the death penalty. Illinois Gov. George Ryan has placed a moratorium on executions, and Bush and Vice President Al Gore have been forced to address the issue as they campaign for president. 

 Graham's case brought the loudest protests since pickax killer Karla Faye Tucker was executed in 1998, the first woman put to death in Texas since the Civil War era. 

 Six people were arrested outside the prison Thursday for breaking through police lines; other activists burned American flags. Another 150 people protested outside the governor's mansion in Austin. 

 No physical evidence tied Graham to the killing of 53-year-old Bobby Lambert, and ballistics tests showed that the gun he had when he was arrested was not the murder weapon. But the witness who identified him, Bernadine Skillern, has never wavered. 

 Skillern, who was waiting in her car outside the supermarket while her daughter ran inside, saw the holdup from about 30 feet away. She identified Graham as the shooter and said the lighting in the parking lot was adequate. 

 Graham also argued that his lawyer during the trial, Ron Mock, should have introduced other witnesses who would say he was not the killer. But those witnesses initially told police they couldn't identify the killer, and prosecutors said they were not actual eyewitnesses. 

 Bush acknowledged the protests but said he had to uphold the laws of Texas. ''I recognize there are good people who oppose the death penalty,'' he said. ''I've heard their message and I respect their heartfelt point of view.''
