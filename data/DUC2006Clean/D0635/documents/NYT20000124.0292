AUSTIN, Texas _ As a longtime advocate for prison reform and the leader of a national anti-death-penalty organization, Charlie Sullivan has seen the conservative side of presidential candidate George W. Bush. 

 But he's sayd he's still waiting for a glimpse of the Texas governor's compassionate side. 

 Sullivan, the executive director of Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants, or CURE, is attempting to focus the spotlight on Texas' use of the death penalty as voters put Bush through his first tests as this year's Republican front-runner. 

 The effort by Sullivan comes as Texas prepared to execute its fifth inmate this month, with two more executions scheduled during the next two days. 

 ``Our members are working hard, not only in Iowa and New Hampshire, but in the other early primary states, trying to get this issue before the voters,'' said Sullivan, a one-time Texan whose office is in Washington, D.C. ``There have been so many executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of their names.'' 

 Bush, the national front-runner in the GOP presidential nomination race, is an ardent supporter of the death penalty and makes no apology for the fact that he has presided over more executions than any governor in modern U.S. history, and some of the most controversial. 

 ``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said during a recent campaign swing in Iowa. ``The reason I do is that it saves people's lives. ... If the punishment is swift, sure and just, it will save people's lives.'' 

 Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116 inmates to Huntsville's death chamber. Among those was Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman to be executed in the state since the Civil War. Tucker's professed conversion to Christianity became the subject of countless media profiles in the weeks before she was put to death 23 months ago for participating in a 1982 pickax slaying in Houston. 

 Bush withstood pressure to spare Tucker's life from such diverse sources as liberal activist Bianca Jagger and conservative religious broadcaster Pat Robertson before allowing the 38-year-old former prostitute to die. 

 Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor has only limited power to stop an execution. Under state law, the governor may commute a death sentence only if the 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles makes such a recommendation. The governor may, however, grant a condemned inmate a one-time, 30-day stay of execution to allow the courts or the parole board more time to review the case. 

 ``Texas has a governor that is basically leaving it to the bureaucrats and the people he appoints to make these life-and-death decisions,'' Sullivan said. ``He has adopted a policy that says, `Don't bother me unless there's something extraordinary about the case.' '' 

 Bush and his aides have disputed such assertions, arguing that each pending execution weighs heavily on the governor's conscience. Bush has said he reviews cases to ensure that condemned inmates were granted full access to the courts and to erase any doubt about whether inmates are guilty of the crime for which they were sentenced. 

 Opponents say they are frustrated that the death penalty has not been much of an issue in many states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. 

 Alicia Claypool, executive director of the anti-death-penalty Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said capital punishment is ``not on the radar screen'' in that state. 

 ``No one's really talking about crime issues this year,'' said Claypool, who heads the 1,200-member organization. ``Iowa does not have the death penalty, and we've had some periodic battles over whether we should adopt it. But this year, there has been very little mention of it.'' 

 However, Craig Allin, a political science professor at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said there might be growing notice of Texas' execution pace. 

 ``It certainly is on my radar screen,'' Allin said. ``Texas has earned the reputation of being the death penalty capital of the United States. Iowa has an active United Nations Association, various Christian liberal congregations, chapters of Amnesty International, etc., who take the death penalty seriously and who have lobbied against it here in Iowa.'' 

 However, one of Allin's colleagues who is active in Iowa GOP politics, said that such lobbying will likely carry little weight in the caucuses. 

 ``It's not the sort of thing that Republicans will squabble among themselves about,'' said Robert Sutherland, a Cornell political science professor and former Houston resident who supports Bush. ``Even those in the Christian Coalition and the right-to-life movement are far more concerned with the abortion issue than with the death penalty.'' 

 Doug Challenger, a sociology professor at New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce College, said issues of crime and punishment are also taking a back seat in the Granite State. 

 ``I think people up here are aware of what's going on in Texas with all their executions, but it's not making an impact,'' Challenger said. 

 New Hampshire has a death penalty statute, but there has not been an execution there in more than a half-century, Challenger said. 

 As Iowa voters made their choices for president Monday evening, Texas inmate Billy George Hughes was scheduled to be strapped onto the executioner's gurney and given a lethal injection in Huntsville. Two more inmates are scheduled to die this week. 

 Last week, Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry Keith Robison. Hughes' execution Monday night will be followed by Glen McGinnis on Tuesday night and James Moreland on Thursday. 

 Robison's case was the subject of international controversy because his supporters argued that his 1982 murder spree that left five dead in the Fort Worth area was likely fueled by paranoid schizophrenia, a condition that was diagnosed four years earlier. Prosecutors and relatives of the victims have argued that Robison's admitted drug use caused any mental defects. 

 The Vatican, Amnesty International and the European Parliament repeatedly urged Bush to spare Robison, and the same groups are rallying around McGinnis, arguing that he be saved because he was 17 at the time of his crime. 

 Bush has routinely rejected overtures from abroad. When the Canadian government objected to the pending execution of one of its countrymen and a boycott of Texas tourism sites was urged, Bush simply bristled. 

 ``People just can't come into our state and cold-blood murder somebody,'' Bush said before Joseph Stanley Faulder's execution in June. ``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their nationality.'' 

 Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Resource Center, said such rhetoric defies Bush's campaign mantra of ``compassionate conservatism.'' 

 ``Where is all this compassion when it comes to the mentally ill on Death Row, the people who were sent to Death Row for crimes they committed as children?'' Dieter asked. ``He could send a meaningful message about compassion if he would commute their sentences. Not set them free, just keep them in prison for life.''
