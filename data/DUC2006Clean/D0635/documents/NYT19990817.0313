ON PRISONS: More Inmates For Longer Terms 

 Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or parole, a point of pride to many Texans, said Fabelo, the governor's top criminal justice adviser. 

 Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents, second only to Louisiana's 736. By contrast, Minnesota, with the lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people. 

 The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov. Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took office in 1995. 

 In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds. When the buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds. The Bush administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10 billion. 

 In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun to question that state's prison-building program. Republicans worry about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats argue that the program has taken money away from the state college and university system. 

 The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.

 ``There has been a definite trade-off,'' Ms. Castro said. State spending for public schools was 36.4 percent of the budget in 1999, compared with 41.3 percent in 1989, while spending for prisons was 7.8 percent, up from 5.2 percent, she said. 

 Bush's spokeswoman, Ms. Hughes, said that to cope with the growing number of inmates who will eventually be released from prison, the governor is counting on programs like a voluntary Christian boot camp pioneered by Charles Colson, once the special counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, and who served a federal prison term on Watergate-related charges. 

 The program includes Bible study as well as courses on personal responsibility, parenting and financial management. 

 ``I'm absolutely convinced this program will work,'' Bush said after visiting a pilot project at a prison near Houston. ``The best recidivism program is a changed heart.''

 One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms. Richards was a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed the juvenile justice code. One result: a tripling of the number of young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to 6,000. 

 ``If George W. Bush can do for the United States what he has done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself as ``the most conservative man in Texas.'' 

 The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized. 

 Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile prisons. 

 The new code does provide flexibility, Gaither said. Juveniles given long sentences can either be sent to an adult prison when they turn 16, or they can have their sentence reduced if their behavior has improved. Many of these changes have been enacted in other states. 

 ON THE DEATH PENALTY: Leaving Appeals To Higher Power  &QL; 

 Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. 

 Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev. Pat Robertson and other religious leaders. She was only the second woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of capital punishment. 

 This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush ``maneuverability'' to commute Ms. Tucker's sentence without offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death penalty. 

 But in one of his most publicized moments as governor, Bush chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or guilty? And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death have been guilty.'' 

 Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms. Tucker becoming born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority.''

 In August the Tucker execution again became an issue for Bush, because of a profile in Talk magazine that quoted him as mocking Ms. Tucker's pleading for her life. His campaign officials have denied the profile's characterization of the governor, saying his comments were misread.

 Bush did halt one execution, that of Henry Lee Lucas, one of the nation's most notorious multiple murderers, who had already been given several life sentences for other killings. Citing evidence that Lucas had been nowhere near the scene of the crime for which Texas was about to executive him, Bush commuted his sentence to life in prison. 

 Americans support the death penalty by a large majority, with 71 percent in favor and only 21 percent opposed, according to a Harris Poll released in July. 

 Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally retarded. Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 

 After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,'' with juries having the right to make the decision. The bill died in the House. 

 In another measure to deal with the number of executions and the growing number of inmates, the Texas Senate and House unanimously passed a bill this spring to create a state public defender system, guaranteeing that indigent defendants be assigned a lawyer within 20 days of arrest. 

 Currently defense lawyers are appointed by elected local judges, often from among their campaign contributors, leading to charges of cronyism, delays and incompetence. 

 Bush vetoed the bill. ``While well-intentioned,'' he said, the bill proposed ``drastic changes'' that would have lowered the quality of representation and posed a danger to the public by requiring that defendants be released if not assigned a lawyer within 20 days.

 The Houston Chronicle, in an editorial, said Bush should have signed the bill, since virtually alone among the states ``Texas has no system at all'' for public defenders. When lawyers appointed by judges are competent, the paper said, they have an ethical conflict, since the judges who pay them want a speedy trial, not an aggressive defense. 

 Ellis, the state senator from Dallas who sponsored the bill, said Bush had given in to lobbying by judges who did not want to lose their patronage system. ``One can be a proponent of the death penalty, as I am,'' said Ellis, ``but also sane enough to realize we need a real public defender system.''
