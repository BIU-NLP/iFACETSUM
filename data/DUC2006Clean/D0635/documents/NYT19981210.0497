The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday halted the execution of a Canadian murderer, saying it wants more time to consider the claims of the 61-year-old man who confessed to bludgeoning an elderly woman and then burying a butcher knife in her chest. 

 The stay was granted about 30 minutes before Joseph Stanley Faulder, convicted in the 1975 murder of the Gladewater, Texas, woman, was to be led into the death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville. 

 Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald broke word of the stay to Faulder, who was being held in a cell a short distance from the death chamber, shortly before 6 p.m. CST 

 ``Far out, that suits me,'' Faulder responded. 

 ``He was a very happy man,'' Fitzgerald said. ``He again thanked the Canadian people and the Canadian media who helped to focus attention on the case.'' 

 That Faulder was notified of the stay only minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution, was ``absolutely abominable,'' said Sandra Babcock, his attorney. 

 Babcock, who was one of two people Faulder asked to witness the execution, detailed the convoluted series of legal actions to save her client, blasting the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for alleged irregularities in its clemency considerations. 

 ``I am delighted, ecstatic,'' she said. ``But half an hour ago, I was saying goodbye to my client for the last time. He was saying goodbye to his sister and niece, who are here. He found out about the stay just minutes before the appointed hour of his execution. That is cruel and unusual punishment.'' 

 Although it had appeared Wednesday that Faulder might escape his date with the executioner based on his claims that Texas' clemency process is unconstitutional, that issue was never raised in the high court, said Doug Danzeiser, an assistant attorney general who handled the case for the state. 

 Instead, Danzeiser said, the Supreme Court granted the stay while it determines if it wants to hold formal arguments on claims that Faulder's rights had been violated under international law and that prosecutors suppressed evidence at his trial. 

 But Maurie Levin, an Austin attorney involved in Faulder's class action lawsuit over Texas' clemency process, said some lawyers were speculating that the Supreme Court may well have granted a stay knowing the clemency issue remained unresolved. 

 Since the only issues in Faulder's case pending before the Supreme Court involved international law and suppression of evidence, it could halt the execution only on those issues, Levin said. 

 ``They may have it in their mind that they think they want to look at the clemency process,'' she said. 

 Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Texas Gov. George W. Bush said the governor ``hopes the courts will review and resolve this legal matter as quickly as possible.'' 

 ``Gov. Bush has said all along that the courts are the proper place to address the legal issues in this case,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director. 

 Adding to the confusion over what won Faulder the stay is the fact that two different panels of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled differently Thursday on the clemency issue, Levin said. 

 On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin halted the executions of Faulder and another killer, Danny Barber. 

 Barber was sentenced to die for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise Ingram at her home in Balch Springs, a suburb southeast of Dallas. He also confessed to three other slayings for which he received life sentences. 

 Sparks found that since the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles casts its votes on clemency in secrecy there is no way to determine whether the Texas process meets due process requirements that the Supreme Court has said must exist. 

 The state appealed Sparks' rulings to the 5th Circuit. One three-judge panel overturned the stay in Faulder's case, but another three-judge panel refused to in Barber's case. 

 Faulder, who would have been the first Canadian to be executed in the United States since 1952, had been on Texas' death row 21 years. 

 His death sentence focused international opposition on Texas' death penalty, with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy joining U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in calling for a reprieve. 

 Faulder, an auto mechanic who had served time in Canada for auto theft, never denied that he had fatally beat and stabbed 75-year-old Inez Phillips during a 1975 robbery at her Gladewater home. 

 ``I don't say that I shouldn't be here,'' he told Canadian television reporters in November. ``I say that death row should not exist. Period.'' 

 Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976. 

 Much criticism of Texas centered on the allegation that state authorities had violated an international treaty in not allowing Faulder to contact Canadian consular officials after he was arrested. Texas authorities said the killer was carrying a Colorado drivers license at the time of his arrest, and his nationality was not immediately known. 

 ``At no time did we prevent or prohibit him from calling the Canadian Embassy,'' former Gregg County District Attorney Odis Hill told The Associated Press. ``If he thought that he got such a raw deal and that the embassy could have helped, don't you think he would have contacted them before he sat on death row for 15 years?'' 

 Fifteen years elapsed before his family and the Canadian government learned of his incarceration in Texas. 

 A new execution date cannot be set for Faulder unless the Supreme Court lifts its stay; under state law, at least 30 days must elapse between the lifting of a stay and the setting of a new death date. 

 The decision by the Supreme Court also leaves standing orders by Sparks, the federal judge, to conduct evidentiary hearings on the clemency procedures in Texas. Sparks set hearing dates of Dec. 21 and Dec. 22 in Faulder's and Barber's cases, respectively. 

 In ordering the hearings, Sparks took a swipe at the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for not settling the issue. 

 ``This court bemoans the fact that neither of the state's highest courts have ruled on the merits of Faulder's claims or stayed the execution to give themselves time to consider the merits,'' Sparks wrote. 

 Faulder's claims that Texas' clemency procedures are constitutionally flawed are nearly identical to the claims that attorneys for Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the 1800s, raised last year before she was executed. Tucker, however, never was granted a stay on those claims. 

 In his Faulder opinion, Sparks noted that at the time Tucker raised her claims, there was no case law laying out a constitutional right to clemency under federal law. 

 After Tucker was executed, though, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of an Ohio prisoner who challenged that state's parole procedures. In that case, Sparks noted, five justices ``agreed that a death-row inmate has a life interest in avoiding execution separate and independent from his life and liberty interests at stake in his trial and sentencing, and therefore `some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings.''' 

 Although the Supreme Court did not specify what process would meet minimal standards, Sparks wrote, ``it is unclear where the Texas procedure would fall'' because the parole board does not specify how it reaches its decisions. 

 ``It is unclear how the board can document that its procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures at all,'' Sparks wrote. 

 Dave Atwood, president of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and one of Tucker's attorneys, praised the Supreme Court's decision and the pressure Canadian capital punishment opponents had applied in the case. 

 ``If not for them, this execution would have gone forward,'' he said. 

 Faulder's niece, Barbara Allen, 39, of Jasper, Alberta, said she was ``ecstatic'' about the stay, then noted the word hardly conveyed the level of emotion she felt. 

 She said she had visited her uncle Thursday afternoon _ her fourth visit with him since her arrival Saturday _ and found him composed. ``He has had a long time to prepare for this,'' she said. ``But he was emotional, too. When we left, I said, 'See you tomorrow,' and I will.''
