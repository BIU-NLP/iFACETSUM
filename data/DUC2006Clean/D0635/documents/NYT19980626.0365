AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush followed his parole board's advice Friday and halted Tuesday's planned execution of Henry Lee Lucas, saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed killer's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row. 

 ``I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case carefully,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``The first question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the individual's guilt or innocence. 

 ``This is the first case since I have been the governor when the answer to that question is `Yes.' '' 

 Lucas, 61, once confessed to 600 killings. He was scheduled to die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near Interstate 35 in Williamson County. 

 But, as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to, evidence later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the crime was committed. 

 Bush's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville's Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system's diagnostic center, where he will undergo psychological evaluation and other tests before being permanently reassigned. 

 ``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the guts to stand up for what's right,'' Lucas said in a statement released by prison officials. 

 Bush's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his freedom. He is serving six other life sentences, and 210 years in prison for nine other murders. 

 A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas. 

 Bush, a staunch defender of the death penalty, has not intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office 3 1/2 years ago. 

 In February, he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a couple in Houston. 

 Numerous religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, called for Tucker to be spared. Bush said he allowed the execution to go forward because she was undeniably guilty. Tucker, who never claimed innocence, became the first woman to be executed in Texas since the Civil War. 

 Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986 investigation by his office, which showed that the condemned man was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred. 

 Mattox, a Democrat who is again running for attorney general, and Bush, a Republican, said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and should never be released from prison. But carrying out the execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would be abhorrent, both said. 

 ``Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox, who added that police should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions. ``But it was still politically risky, and I'd be glad to stand up and defend him against attack.'' 

 Bush's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn, who is running against Mattox in the attorney general's race. 

 ``I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in the 23 (appellate) judges who reviewed the evidence,'' said Cornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court Justice. ``I believe their decision should be respected and their sentence carried out.'' 

 A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro, Bush's opponent in November's election, said the governor may see some political fallout from his actions. 

 ``The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he wouldn't get involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker, but he's following Jim Mattox's lead on Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Joe Cutbirth, Mauro's spokesman. 

 Bush's decision in the Lucas case, made public 24 hours after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its recommendation, caps one of Texas' most bizarre crime sagas. 

 Lucas, a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his mother, was arrested in Montague County, Texas, in June 1983 for being an ex-con with a weapon. While in jail, he confessed to killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in Ringgold. 

 He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West. 

 Other confessions followed, and soon Lucas' tally of death numbered in the hundreds. Almost all were later proved to have been hoaxes, but Williamson County officials prosecuted him for the 1979 slaying and secured the death penalty.
