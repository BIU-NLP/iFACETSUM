SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ In a step he had never taken over the course of 131 executions in five years, Gov. George W. Bush Thursday night agreed to a 30-day reprieve for a death-row inmate in Texas, citing concerns that adequate tests on DNA evidence in the case had not been performed. 

 Bush made his decision, which he had telegraphed well in advance, after both the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court late Thursday rejected final-hour pleas by lawyers for the inmate, Ricky Nolen McGinn, who had been scheduled for execution by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Central time. 

 McGinn was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993, but Bush acknowledged over recent days that the DNA evidence connecting McGinn to the rape was inconclusive and might be clarified by modern tests. It was the rape, layered on top of the murder, that qualified McGinn for a death sentence. 

 Bush, who had just arrived at the state capitol building here for a conference of governors, announced the stay only about 15 minutes before the originally scheduled time for McGinn's execution. Bush noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by Texas state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who was technically acting as governor while Bush and the lieutenant governor were both out of the state. 

 ``I have recommended and Senator Ellis has accepted my recommendation to grant a 30-day reprieve in the case of Mr. McGinn,'' Bush told a group of reporters who huddled around him in a corridor of the state capitol building here. 

 ``Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we need to use it,'' Bush explained, in a straightforward, unemotional voice. ``We're doing so in the state of Texas. I expect the courts and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape in the case of Ricky McGinn.'' 

 Because Bush is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny _ none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty. Texas easily leads the nation in executions. 

 Although his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also supports capital punishment, some of his allies would like to use the issue to cast doubt on Bush's efforts to portray himself as a ``compassionate conservative.'' 

 Additionally, Bush's unusual action in the case of McGinn underscored the way in which modern DNA testing and technology have begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt on convictions once considered solid and just. 

 In recent months, even some staunch conservatives have begun to acknowledge qualms about capital punishment, in light of a number of death sentences that have been overturned recently after DNA testing exonerated the inmates. How these developments will ultimately affect public support for the death penalty, which has been broad and strong and often independent of political party affiliation, remains unclear. 

 Bush's aides said that his action was not even remotely influenced by politics and noted that he had made many tough and unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past, including several since he declared his candidacy for the presidency. 

 As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a 30-day reprieve of an execution. He cannot pardon someone or commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and, under those circumstances, has commuted only one death sentence over the last year, sparing the life of Henry Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer. 

 In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with questions emerging about some of the testimony and material marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the particular conviction for which he received his death sentence. 

 But this was the first time that Bush agreed to a reprieve for a death-row inmate, and he did it against the wishes of the pardons board, which had voted 11-7 not to stay McGinn's execution. For the moment, Bush's action merely delays McGinn's execution, although his lawyers hope that they can now perform new DNA tests that will shed new doubt on McGinn's guilt. 

 What Bush did Thursday, and the way in which he presaged it with a series of remarks on Wednesday, suggested that he was at least somewhat sensitive to his image as an especially fervent advocate of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that allowed him to temper it. 

 In the past, Bush had almost always waited for courts to complete their reviews of death-row inmates' appeals before he signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter. 

 But Bush broke from that pattern this time around, gladly telling reporters on Wednesday that he was likely to grant McGinn a 30-day reprieve. At the time, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had yet to rule on the issue, and McGinn's lawyers had not turned to the U.S. Supreme Court. 

 Several Republican political strategists around the country said that they doubted Bush was simply trying to soften his image by showing a capacity for clemency. They noted that public support for capital punishment still runs high and that Bush three years ago declined to grant a reprieve in a much showier, more widely covered case: that of a woman named Karla Faye Tucker. 

 ``I don't think that this is political,'' said Mike Murphy, who was the principal strategist for Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign. But, Murphy added, ``The truth is that the explosion in DNA technology has really changed the death penalty dynamic, and perhaps he's taking that reality into account a little bit.'' 

 Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday afternoon that McGinn's case was the first one Bush has faced as governor in which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the question of innocence or guilt. 

 ``The DNA testing at the trial level was inconclusive and there's an opportunity to get more information now from that test, so he feels it's the right thing to do,'' Hughes said. ``These are life and death decisions, and Governor Bush makes them based on principle.''
