 DAM-FISH (Undated) _ A panel of scientists assembled by the federal government says punching holes in four Snake River dams in southeastern Washington is the best way to help endangered salmon there. But that conclusion drew unmerciful fire in the region and in the halls of Congress. So this week federal fisheries managers will tell Pacific Northwesterners, in effect: ``OK, you figure out what to do.'' They will offer a menu of other, equally unpleasant alternatives that, among other things, have the potential to cause a faceoff between Washington and Idaho over water rights.

 AUTISM-SPECIAL (Undated) _ Special package: Autism is a mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out of 500 and 1 out of 1,000 children. Scientists cannot agree on the incidence, except to say it appears to be growing. No one knows exactly why. But the rise is fueling an unprecedented concern over the best way to help children with autism, as well as intensified research into possible causes and cures.

 AUTISM-CURE (Undated) _ When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged with calls. Fifty-one slots. Four hundred families.

 AUTISM-CAUSE (Undated) _ The only thing more puzzling than autism itself is why it appears to be on the rise. Grasping at clues, researchers and parents have come up with a variety of theories _ many of them at odds with one another. But so far, the answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves.

 AUTISM-KIDS (Undated) _ On the outside, the Brestler house looks like any number of gracious Eastside homes for a growing family with three children. On the inside, it's a little different. But it's not obvious at first. There are invisible alarms on all the doors here, to keep children from wandering away. And what looks like a well-appointed playroom is really a fully equipped behavioral therapy center. The Brestlers have three boys. The two youngest have autism.

 TV-BEST (Undated) _ Just to stay on top of the game, conscientious TV critics _ and they all know who they are _ watch a lot of stuff they don't necessarily like. This helps explain the times they've had to tell loved ones they couldn't go out to Chez Chimichanga for the free-range chicken burrito on a Friday night because they had to stay home and watch ABC's TGIF lineup.
