&UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL; Support services for people with autism _ children and adults alike _ fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new study. 

 And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside their family homes, the researchers say. 

 People with autism, a disorder that affects brain development, tend to have trouble communicating and relating to the outside world. More than a half-million Americans have autism or some form of pervasive developmental disorder, says the Autism Society of America. 

 More cases of autism are being diagnosed than ever before, in part because of changes in diagnostic criteria, says study co-author Marsha Seltzer, a professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

 ``The service system is experiencing a crunch. In some states, families have to have to wait several years or longer to get the services they need,'' Seltzer says. 

 Although many people think of autism as a childhood disease, she says it's really a lifelong struggle. 

 ``Parents just shoulder a tremendous responsibility,'' Seltzer says. 

 ``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis,'' she says. After that, she says, ``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never leaves the sphere of the family.'' 

 Many families surveyed by Seltzer and her colleagues think their autistic children lack essential services. Her on-going long-term study involves approximately 400 Wisconsin families who have either an adolescent or adult child with autism. Roughly 40 percent of the autistic participants are aged 20 to 50. 

 David Holmes, who chairs the Autism Society of America's panel of professional advisors, echoes the sentiments of the study. 

 ``The complexities of autism require more specialized adult services,'' Holmes says. 

 Autistic people need specialized services, experts say, because the disease is multifaceted, with wide-ranging symptoms, and because autistic people often have a secondary condition. 

 More than 80 percent of the autistic subjects, for instance, also have mental retardation, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a seizure disorder, the researchers say. 

 Without special help, especially for autistic adults living away from their parents, behavioral and social problems develop, say the researchers. 

 Because autistic people need a stimuli-controlled environment, as well as fairly constant training in communications, behavior management and task completion, Holmes says generic programs don't work _ and even can harm those with autism. 

 ``Adult services for other forms of developmental disabilities are not often appropriate for adults with autism,'' Homes says. 

 But, he says, ``Adults with autism can continue to develop new skills if only given the chance.'' 

 Seltzer and her colleagues presented their early findings last week at a meeting of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Disability in Seattle. Funded by the National Institute on Aging, the study is a joint effort by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass.
