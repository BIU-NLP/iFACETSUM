Scientists for the first time have discovered what they believe may be biological markers in the blood of newborn infants who later develop autism and mental retardation. The markers consist of abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals that help construct the basic architecture of animal brains, researchers said. The finding supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from birth. 

 The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be replicated in larger studies. But if it proves true, it could open the door to new opportunities for treating these devastating mental disorders that affect as many as six out of every 1,000 newborns. If doctors can screen for autism and mental retardation at birth, scientists say, affected babies could be given special early enrichments or drugs designed to help their brains develop more normally. 

 The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by Dr. Karin B. Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., was carried out by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. Nelson said in a telephone interview that the study was in the process of being submitted to a scientific journal. 

 The new work ``is really exciting,'' said Dr. David Amaral, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis and a leading expert on neurodevelopmental disorders, who was not involved in the study. The world of autism research is littered with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of attacking the problem at a basic scientific level. 

 ``If this study can be replicated and confirmed, it will be very important,'' said Dr. Eric Courchesne, an autism expert at the University of California in San Diego. People have been looking for triggers, like measles vaccinations, to help explain the onset of autism symptoms, he said. But this study suggests that the defects may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas about the cause of these disorders,'' he said. 

 Still, it could turn out that these brain proteins ``are not predictive of anything,'' said Dr. Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist and autism expert at the University of Chicago. ``The work is exciting and I hope it's correct,'' he said, but the fact that four proteins are elevated ``does not mean there is one simple pathway'' in the brain to explain these disorders. 

 Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said. But this notion has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around 3 years old. There has never been a way to identify the babies who might have these brain abnormalities and so researchers have not been able study the problem early in life. 

 The latest findings are the result of a collaboration of researchers from three scientific disciplines: neurochemistry, epidemiology and analytical immunochemistry. 

 Neurochemists have identified many brain proteins that help cells survive, make connections between cells and lay the basis for learning and memory, Nelson said. The thinking was that some of these molecules might be involved in autism and mental retardation, but which ones remained a mystery. ``We chose eight of them,'' Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition.'' 

 The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley. The program, established nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to help track down causes of birth defects. For example, the program recently helped show a link between babies born with cleft palates and mothers who smoked cigarettes. 

 The blood samples are stored in a warehouse and can be fetched any time epidemiologists have questions to explore, said Dr. John Harris, director of the program. In this case, staff members in the program went to clinics in Northern California and located teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism, 65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls. All the teen-agers were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in the warehouse. 

 The samples were sent to Dr. Terry Phillips, an immunochemist at George Washington University and at the Office of Research Services at the National Institutes of Health who uses sophisticated new techniques to fish tiny amounts of proteins out of blood samples. Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers, he said. But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers. None of the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy had elevated levels of these proteins, he said. 

 High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns'' present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers said. While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said. Too much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many children. 

 Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not normal in regard to these proteins at birth.
