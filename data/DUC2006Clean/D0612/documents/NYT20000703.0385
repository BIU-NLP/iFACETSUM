ATLANTA _ Aside from Hollywood's sometimes inaccurate portrayal of autism, few people know much about the disorder. 

 A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the incidence of autism. The conference continues through Wednesday. 

 ``We hope to bring in 1,000 attendees, and, hopefully, people will have a better understanding about autism at the end of the conference,'' said Vernell Henry, director of conferences for the society. 

 Parents and people whose family members are affected by autism are the target group of the conference, which is organized around five areas: communications; education; family and community; medicine and research; and options for adulthood and independence. 

 Autism was previously thought to affect one in 500 people, but the number is actually closer to one in 250, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

 Here are some frequently asked questions about the disorder, with answers by the Autism Society of America: 

 Q: What is autism? 

 A: Autism is a complex developmental disease that is four times more prevalent in boys than girls. It affects the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. No one knows what the cause of autism is. It knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries. 

 Adults and children living with autism usually have difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication, and leisure or play activities. In some cases, aggressive and self-injurious behavior may be present. They may exhibit repeated body movements, such as hand flapping and rocking, unusual responses to people or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routine. Some people with autism may also have other disorders that affect functioning of the brain such as epilepsy, mental retardation and Down syndrome. They may also have genetic disorders such as Tourette's syndrome or Williams syndrome. 

 Q: What causes autism? 

 A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain, but no specific cause. Autism is not a mental illness. It is not caused by bad parenting, and children with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave. 

 Q: What are some of the treatments? 

 A: Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to highly structured, specialized education programs tailored to their needs. Early intervention leads to better results. 

 Q: Is there a way to diagnose autism? 

 A: There are no medical tests. Accurate diagnoses should be based on observation of an individual's communication, behavior and developmental levels. Signs of autism typically appear during the first three years of life. 

 Q: Should parents shelter their children once it is determined they have autism? 

 A: ``It is very important that children be kept close to other developing children,'' said Gail McGee, director of the autism center at Emory University. Parents should push for children's inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and development in that area, she said.
