When Evan Rosenberg was 2 years old, he didn't play like other children. 

 He spent hours gazing out the window, clapping his hands. He didn't make eye contact with his mother. He wasn't talking. He couldn't point to objects, or follow basic commands. 

 Fearing her son couldn't hear, Wendie Rosenberg took him to an audiologist. 

 ``The audiologist said there's nothing wrong with his hearing,'' she said. 

 Then he said a word that strikes a chord of panic in a parent's heart: autism. 

 ``I thought autism meant sitting and rocking in a corner, severe mental retardation and no skills at all,'' Rosenberg said. ``I couldn't say the word `autism' for a year. It was like falling into a black hole and not being able to get out.'' 

 That was seven years ago. 

 Today, Evan rushes to the door to greet visitors. He not only makes eye contact and talks, he's doing fourth-grade-level work in most subjects. He still has autistic traits, including a slightly formal manner of speech, and a propensity for re-enacting conversations to himself. 

 But for the most part, he just blends in. 

 Evan, 10, is one of an exploding population of children with autism in Washington. He also is one of the success stories, a child who functions almost independently in a normal, mainstreamed classroom after years of intensive, one-on-one therapy to draw him into the world of his peers. 

 Autism is a mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out of 500 and 1 out of 1,000 children. Scientists cannot agree on the incidence, except to say it appears to be growing. 

 No one knows exactly why. But the rise is fueling an unprecedented concern over the best way to help children with autism, as well as intensified research into possible causes and cures. 

 A study by the California Health and Human Services Agency this year found that the number of people with autism in California had nearly quadrupled (up 273 percent) between 1987 and 1998, a time when the population base increased 19 percent. 

 Other studies have put the increase as high as 500 percent or 600 percent, said Portia Iversen, founder of California-based Cure Autism Now Foundation and the parent of a 7-year-old autistic son. 

 In Washington, programs that take children with autism are having to turn children away. 

 ``In 20 years, we've never had a wait list,'' said Mimi Siegel, executive director of the Kindering Center, an early-childhood development program in Bellevue. ``We have always been able to shoehorn kids in.'' 

 Until this year. 

 The situation has gotten so acute that a group of 30 local families has banded together to lobby for improved services and persuaded Children's Hospital to begin a program specializing in pediatric autism. Due to be in operation early next year, the center will be jointly run by the hospital and the University of Washington's Center on Human Development and Disability. 

 For parents like these, the rising caseload is chilling. The disease impairs a child's ability to form language and relationships, and strikes at the very heart of being human _ the ability to connect with other people. 

 As one mother puts it, ``It's as though someone broke into my home and stole my child's mind and left his helpless body.'' 

 Autism affects imagination, communication, social interaction and reasoning ability, creating a spectrum of impairments. Children may develop odd ritualistic behaviors, quirky language patterns, or hypersensitivities to stimuli, such as sounds. 

 No two children with autism are alike. Some develop high verbal skills, but their thinking remains concrete. Others understand language perfectly, but remain mute. Some children fixate on objects, such as car wheels, or develop narrowly focused obsessions, such as with weather broadcasts. 

 Some flap their hands. Some bang their heads. Some make eye contact readily. Others seem lost in their own worlds. 

 Evan's success is the kind of story that parents of young children with autism dream of and pray for, give up their jobs and sometimes their life savings to achieve. Only about half of children with autism respond to treatment as well as Evan did. The problem: Researchers can't tell in advance which 50 percent will respond. 

 The refrigerator myth: First described in 1943, autism was once thought to be a disease of upper-middle-class dysfunctional families. The myth of the ``refrigerator mother'' _ a parent who failed to attach to the child _ persisted until the late 1960s, when research began uncovering the neurological roots of the disorder. 

 Today, scientists have identified some patterns of brain abnormalities that may reveal the organic, biological basis for the disease. Overall, for example, children with autism tend to have slightly bigger heads with heavier brains. 

 Many children with autism have anomalies in various brain structures. Brain-damage studies and post-mortem analyses have found differences in the frontal lobes, which help plan and process complex information; the cerebellum, which is involved in motor coordination; and the limbic system, which helps regulate emotions and social behavior. 

 The locations of the damage help explain some of the symptoms of autism. Scientists now believe the neural connections aren't ``wired'' the same way in damaged areas, making it impossible to deliver the right signals. 

 ``Most social interactions require ability to process complex sets of information, such as facial expressions, body movements, language, all at once, and monitor our own role in the conversation,'' said Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the autism project at the UW. ``The timing of it and the complexity of it is too much (for children with autism.)'' 

 Scientists are still puzzling out how this process is interrupted. 

 ``How does something that leaves 99 percent of the brain normal, how does it derail so many diffuse psychological functions?'' said Dr. Alan Unis, associate professor of psychiatry at the UW School of Medicine. 

 And even more puzzling _ how does autism occasionally result in ``savants,'' such as the character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie ``Rain Man''? 

 ``Some children (with autism) have islets of preserved, or exceptional, ability,'' Dawson said. These so-called ``splinter skills'' may show up as amazing feats of memory, or exceptional abilities in math, music, drawing or the ability to decode puzzles. 

 ``It's similar to a person who is blind who has more acute hearing or ability to use touch,'' she said. ``If you're not using certain areas of the brain involved with language and people, other areas having to do with objects, space and numbers are exercised.'' 

 Autism has sometimes been called ``mind blindness,'' an attempt to describe how difficult it is for children with autism to be able to imagine, or ``see,'' what's going on in the minds of others, an essential task for forming social relationships. Many children with autism don't know, anticipate or react to what others are thinking. This makes the world a confusing, unreadable, unpredictable place and contributes to the child's isolation. 

 Biochemical fingerprints: 

 The UW, which has one of the largest autism research programs in the country, currently has several long-term studies under way looking at how brain structure and activity correlates with the development of autistic traits. 

 Using tools such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a way of visualizing brain tissue, researchers are working to identify the ``biochemical fingerprints'' of the disorder by identifying which areas of the brain are associated with different symptoms. 

 Tying these biochemical patterns and the source of the damage to specific types of behavior is a complicated task, but scientists believe it will help them develop early predictors of outcome and better treatments. 

 Scientists are particularly interested in correlating areas of brain abnormality with outcome of interventions, Dawson said. It is believed there are different subtypes of autism, and the goal is to find the best form of treatment for each one. 

 For families, treatment is the most pressing concern. 

 The Rosenbergs tried many ``remedies,'' including special ``anti-yeast'' diets and vitamins from Europe. 

 ``Families are so vulnerable,'' she said. ``We had a whole biochemical work-up, spent thousands of dollars not covered by insurance. But for him, (diet) wasn't the answer.'' 

 Finally, they started applied behavioral therapy, a form of intensive, highly repetitive teaching that breaks learning into tiny incremental tasks, each one reinforced with positive rewards. Most children learn by osmosis from their environments. Children with autism need to be taught even the simplest things, like responding to their names. 

 The process is strict, labor-intensive and excruciatingly time-consuming. It can take days or weeks to learn a task as simple as pointing, years to learn language. 

 ``We had to teach him how to nod,'' Rosenberg said. ``We had to teach him what language was for.'' At first, Evan was oblivious. They kept at it, 20 to 25 hours a week, month after month. 

 ``It was intense. We lost all our privacy,'' she said. ``People were constantly in and out. But we kept him engaged, kept him focused.'' 

 Within three months, Evan was making eye contact, playing with blocks, pointing spontaneously to objects and forming words. 

 ``At the beginning, people who don't know about (behavioral therapy) think we're breaking their spirit,'' Rosenberg said. ``But you'll never hear that (criticism) from parents whose children do it.'' 

 Today, Evan continues to get 10 hours of therapy a week outside of school, and he continues to make progress, one task at a time. 

 This year, for example, he went to day camp without a full-time aide for the first time. 

 Rosenberg is heartened by his progress, and his acceptance into the world of his typical peers. 

 ``When we first started this journey, we were advised don't ever tell anyone (your child has autism) because their expectations will drop,'' she said. 

 On this day, Evan and his therapist, Kim Domis, are setting out more goals, tasks and rewards in Evan's tidy upstairs bedroom. They are working on reading comprehension as well as manners and figures of speech. Like many children with autism, Evan understands language at a literal level, but struggles to understand its abstractions. 

 There's a rhythm to the therapy. A question. An answer. A mark on the board. 

 The marks accumulate. The minutes go by. When he meets his goals, he gets a reward. Every 10 minutes or so, he gets a break. 

 ``What does it mean to find a needle in a haystack?'' Domis asks. 

 ``It's hard to find,'' Evan says. He seems pleased when he gets his answers right. 

 They move on to working story problems in math. Occasionally, Domis throws in an unexpected question. 

 ``What does it mean to stay on your toes?'' she asks. 

 ``Pay attention.'' Evan looks to make sure he gets a point for the correct answer. 

 At the break, he gets to work on a jigsaw puzzle, one of his favorite activities. Today it's a rhinoceros puzzle, a complicated adult one with more than 1,000 pieces. 

 ``Remember just three pieces,'' Domis says. 

 ``Just remembering,'' he says. 

 ``Thanks, Evan.'' 

 ``You're welcome, Kim.'' 

 There are stacks of completed puzzles mounted on boards against the wall, each assembled a piece at a time, like the neural circuits in his brain. 

 The break's over, and he's back at work. He picks up his reading-comprehension book. 

 ``Is that a book you can judge by its cover?'' Domis asks. 

 Evan laughs. 

 ``You can't judge a book by its cover,'' he says. ``Means you can't tell what's on the inside.''
