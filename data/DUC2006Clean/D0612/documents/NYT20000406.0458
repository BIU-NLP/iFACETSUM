After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of autism. 

 The agreement came after arguments among witnesses and sparring between leaders of the House Government Reform Committee, in which the hearing was held. The hearing was called by Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., whose granddaughter has autism, and who believes she may have got it from a vaccine _ even though current research has not found any connection between getting vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, and the onset of the brain disorder, autism. 

 Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking minority leader on the committee, prodded witnesses and complained to Burton that the hearing was unfairly stacked to show a connection. He said that while getting the science right was important, in this case getting parents to mistrust vaccines would certainly lead to deaths from diseases society has mostly beaten. 

 Mainstream medical organizations and leaders in the field of immunization agree that there is no convincing evidence for the theory that the vaccine called MMR _ measles, mumps and rubella _ causes autism, a brain disorder characterized by an inability to socialize and a tendency to engage in constantly repeated actions or comments. 

 The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause some cases of autism is Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London. He said he took his cue from parents whose experience of autism seemed to be different than the usual. The disease is suspected in most cases of being genetic, and it appears gradually in the first two years of life as a failure to speak, the beginning of repetitive motions, and a withdrawal from social interaction. But the parents Wakefield dealt with said it came on rather suddenly, over a period of months, and often just after vaccination with the triple vaccine. 

 The signature symptoms, he reports, are bowel pain, inflammation and erratic bowel habits, in children who also begin to show the usual mental symptoms of autism. Wakefield has published studies on a dozen such cases, and will soon publish reports on another 60. He said there is some suggestive laboratory work, as well, but the chief message he said was: ``Here is something we need to study.'' 

 On the opposite side, apart from the skepticism of most of the medical community, is Dr. Brent Taylor, a senior colleague of Wakefield at the same London Medical School. 

 Taylor has done the largest and best-controlled study to date on the subject, of 498 autistic children in London. He found no relation between the children's vaccination dates and the onset of their disease. The disease is usually diagnosed when retarded development shows up in the first two years of life; vaccination usually is done at about 16 months of age; Parents and doctors noticing the two coming together could be coincidental, he suggests. 

 Burton said that whatever the case with most autism, ``We owe it to our children and grandchildren to ensure we're being diligent in looking for causes of autism. We can't stick our heads in the sand and ignore the possibility.'' 

 Among the parents who told their stories, and who became teary-eyed along with most in the packed hearing room was Shelly Reynolds of Baton Rouge. She said her son Liam was the normal bubbly child who would sing `itsy bitsy spider,' and chime in with Eieio on `Old McDonald.' But within days of his vaccination, she said, he became either unruly or spaced-out, and lost his ability to speak and interact. 

 She told the committee that you cannot miss such sudden awful and sudden changes if you are a parent. ``Parents like me are relying on you to demand that the pharmaceutical companies retrace their steps once again, and the public health community look at the possibility that these things might not be a coincidence.'' 

 Complicating the whole question, and making it more urgent at the same time, is the dramatic rise in the reporting of autism in several countries, including the United States. In the 1960s, various estimates suggested there were about one to four cases of autism for every 10,000 children. By the 1990s, the numbers had shot up more than four-fold to 12 per 10,000 in England, and two-to-five fold in different studies in the U.S. 

 But it is unclear whether the increase is due to increased reporting of the disease, which has become much better known in recent years, especially after the film `Rain Man' about an autistic man. 

 After listening to exchanges of scientific details for two hours, Waxman read the language of a proposed letter to the secretary of Health and Human Services asking for an impartial study of the question; Burton agreed to co-sign it, but added that he will continue to dog the issue with further hearings until better answers are forthcoming.
