 AUTISM2 (Phoenix) _ Days after her first secretin injection last year, Rebecca David slept until 7:30 a.m. It was a remarkable development for a girl who for years had been rousing her parents at 4 a.m. Rebecca's family, along with several dozen others in the Valley, called the Southwest Autism Research Center in Phoenix with the good news: Their autistic children were sleeping better, eating better, communicating more easily. The parents attributed the differences to secretin, a drug they hoped would help free their children from &UR; autism, a developmental disorder that has baffled researchers for 50 years. There was only one problem: Almost all the 30 Phoenix-area children in the yearlong clinical trial of secretin reported great results _ even though a third had received a placebo. By JODIE SNYDER.
