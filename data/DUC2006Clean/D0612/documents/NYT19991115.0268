The only thing more puzzling than autism itself is why it appears to be on the rise. 

 Grasping at clues, researchers and parents have come up with a variety of theories _ many of them at odds with one another. But so far, the answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves. 

 The most likely explanation is that there are multiple causes, and that some interaction between genetic and environmental factors causes brain development to go awry. 

 Proposed triggers range from milk or wheat allergies to viruses or environmental toxins. 

 Many children with autism, for example, have digestive problems, including food allergies, a phenomenon that has given rise to the ``rogue peptide'' theory. The idea is that children who have trouble digesting wheat gluten or cow's milk create peptides that mimic natural hormones or neurotransmitters. When these rogue peptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal development. 

 Other theories postulate that autism develops after something triggers an autoimmune response in the brain. 

 One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the protective sheath around nerve fibers. 

 The viral connection has been fueled by anecdotal evidence from parents whose children first showed autistic symptoms after being immunized with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is usually given between 12 and 15 months. So far, however, no scientific studies have been able to link vaccines and autism. 

 According to a recent report in the British medical journal Lancet, for example, the incidence of autism in the United Kingdom has been increasing since 1979. The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988, but there was no sharp increase in cases of autism after that. 

 In addition, the average age of onset of autism is the same for children whether they have been vaccinated or not, further weakening a proposed link between the vaccine and the disorder. 

 But parents are still worried, and researchers acknowledge the question needs further study. 

 Although the debate surrounding viruses continues, there is some definitive evidence that outside agents can cause autism. 

 For example, it is known that babies whose mothers took the anti-nausea drug thalidomide at 28 days' gestation have a much higher incidence of autism. 

 Autism also has been associated with children born to mothers who were given drugs to control their epilepsy, said Dr. Alan Unis, associate professor of psychiatry at the UW. 

 Those examples suggest the development of autism is foreshadowed in the earliest stages of embryonic brain development. 

 There may be many more unknown agents that could cause such damage. 

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, have been investigating whether an unusually high incidence of autism in Brick Township, N.J., could be related to environmental causes, or is simply a statistical artifact. There have been 40 cases of autism diagnosed among the 6,000 3- to 10-year-old children living in the township, a rate that is at least triple the estimated national average. 

 Whatever the cause, the overall rise in the incidence of autism nationally has been dramatic. 

 ``It's very difficult to estimate prevalence,'' Dawson said. ``Twenty years ago, we said 4 or 5 out of 10,000. Today, we say 1 in 500 or 1,000. 

 ``We don't know if the increase in prevalence is accounted for entirely by diagnostic methods getting better, or whether there is an (actual) increase.'' Clinicians, however, say the increase is real. 

 ``Absolutely, it's becoming more common,'' said psychology professor Eric Trupin who heads the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle. 

 And some parents say the many competing theories don't have to be mutually exclusive. 

 ``Autism causes such a broad spectrum (of symptoms),'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America and parent of a 31-year-old son with autism. ``There has to be more than one cause.''
