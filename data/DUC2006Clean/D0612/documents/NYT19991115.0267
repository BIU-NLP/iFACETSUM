When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged with calls. 

 Fifty-one slots. 

 Four hundred families. 

 The overwhelming response is an indication of how desperate families are for something that works better than available methods. 

 Hopes surrounding secretin, a natural digestive hormone that may help treat autism, have been building since two parents accidentally discovered that the hormone appeared to help their autistic child. In 1996, Victoria and Gary Beck of New Hampshire went to a gastrointestinal specialist to help diagnose some digestive difficulties in their autistic son, Parker. The doctor injected the boy with porcine secretin, a hormone commonly used to assess gastrointestinal problems. 

 Shortly after the doctor's visit, Parker's autistic traits began improving dramatically. He went from being non-verbal before the injection to saying words. Initially, the Becks had to fight with skeptical doctors to get them to acknowledge that secretin might have had something to do with the results. 

 The biological explanation is not as far-fetched as it might seem. 

 On a basic level, the ``purpose of the brain is to keep the stomach full,'' said Dr. Alan Unis, professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington. 

 The brain and the gut communicate with each other. ``They need to have a common language,'' Unis said. 

 Secretin, which binds to receptors in both the gut and the brain, could form that link. It is plausible that altering secretin levels could affect brain function. 

 It has not taken much convincing for other parents. Publicity about the Becks story has fueled worldwide demand for the hormone, creating shortages and driving up prices. 

 That worried the National Institutes of Health. Although secretin is approved for use as a one-time injection as a diagnostic agent for stomach problems, it hasn't yet been approved for multiple injections as a therapeutic agent. Concerned that children were being given an untried drug with unknown results, the NIH expedited a clinical trial to study the drug's potential. 

 The Seattle group is testing a preparation similar to that used in the Becks' case. The preparation, derived from pigs, is about 60 percent secretin and 40 percent unknown ``pig gut'' ingredients. Researchers are also testing a pure, synthesized version of secretin. The purpose of including both is to rule out the possibility that some other unknown compound in the porcine secretin preparation is having an effect. 

 Each child will get one injection of secretin or a placebo and be evaluated for effects one month later. Researchers expect to have preliminary results in about six months. Children began receiving the injections late last month. 

 However high the hopes, experts warn that secretin is not the first treatment to look promising. 

 ``Autism has a terrible history of wild cures,'' said Eric Trupin, a UW psychology professor who is also director of the child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle. 

 Some work for a few families. None seems to work for all. Most have not been scientifically tested. 

 ``We are a very vulnerable group,'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America. ``Most parents, there's not a thing they wouldn't do if they thought it would cure their child.'' 

 That has led to a parade of treatments, including megavitamins, special diets, auditory training, ``holding therapy'' and swimming with dolphins. 

 Such treatments gain footholds in part because there is a powerful ``placebo effect'' at work. Parents are often so hopeful for results, they see them where objective observers would not. 

 Researchers have seen hopes raised by drugs before. 

 In the 1980s, fenfluramine, a drug that reduces the blood level of serotonin, was being touted as a wonder drug for autism. About one-third of children with autism have higher than normal levels of serotonin, another chemical that acts in both the digestive system and the brain. Initial optimism about the drug faded after studies failed to find beneficial effects. 

 So far, secretin seems promising. Researchers caution, however, that although it is tempting to hope for a pill or a shot that will make autism go away, the reality is likely to be much more complicated. Based on anecdotal reports, secretin seems to have some beneficial effect in about half the families that try it, Unis said. It may be that there is a subtype of autism that responds to secretin. 

 Frustrated by the lack of scientific backing for many treatments, parents have begun organizing to raise money and press for better research. 

 In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of ``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help speed the identification of genes associated with autism. In just over three years, the bank has enrolled 465 families, creating an unrivaled genetic data bank for researchers. 

 Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has a grandson with autism, has co-sponsored legislation to earmark $46.5 million for autism research. The legislation failed this fall, but autism advocates have vowed to redouble their efforts to get the funding this spring. 

 Better understanding of the disease is likely to lead to better treatments, Horne said. ``With autism, we're just beginning to come out of the dark ages.''
