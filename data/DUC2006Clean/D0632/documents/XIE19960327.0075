Jasray said that his current visit is aimed at strengthening bilateral relations and cooperation, adding that such relations in various fields have scored great progress in the past few years. 

 Describing Li's visit to Mongolia in 1994 as important for the smooth development of bilateral relations, Jasray said that the treaty on bilateral friendship and cooperation is functioning as the political and legal basis for bilateral relations. 

 Jasray told Lit that Mongolia attaches importance to its friendly relations with China, which is in the interests of the two peoples, and conducive to regional peace and stability. 

 The Mongolian side appreciated China's policy on good-neighborly ties and China's support for Mongolia as a nuclear-free zone, added Jasray. 

 He also noted that Mongolia is glad to see the marked development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the past few years, and the smooth development of bilateral economic cooperation, especially China's investment in Mongolia. 

 China's economic aid to Mongolia has also played an important role in the economic development of Mongolia, according to Jasray. 

 He reiterated that Mongolia always sticks to a "one China" policy, and recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government representing China. 

 Noting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, Jasray said that Mongolia opposes Taiwan's entry into the United Nations. 

 He added that Mongolia will not have any official contact with Taiwan, except some non-governmental trade exchanges. 

 Li expressed his appreciation for Mongolia's position on the Taiwan question. 

 In addition, the two prime ministers briefed each other on the situations in their respective countries. 

 After the talks, the two sides signed three documents including an agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the two governments. 

 Li hosted a banquet for Jasray and his party who arrived in Beijing at noon today for a four-day official visit as Li's guests. 

 Before the talks, Li presided over a welcoming ceremony for Jasray, and accompanied him in reviewing a guard of honor of the three services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
