BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has always understood the importance of developing a long-term, stable, and good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia, and any changes in Mongolia's political system and government will not affect China's consistent and friendly policies toward the country. 

 Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made the comment here this afternoon during his talks with Mongolian Minister of External Relations Shukher Altangerel, who is on his first visit abroad since he took office. 

 Qian welcomed Altangerel, saying that China and Mongolia are friendly neighbors, and that since the normalization of bilateral ties, the contacts and cooperation in various fields and between different departments of the two sides have kept expanding and moving forward. 

 Qian appreciates Mongolia's stand on maintaining friendly ties with its two great neighbors, China and Russia, and said that through joint efforts, China and Mongolia will always be "good neighbors and friends". 

 Altangerel said China and Mongolia have a long history of contacts, and that the development of bilateral ties is in the interests of the two peoples. 

 He went on to say that there are no unresolved problems between Mongolia and China, and bilateral relations will be further developed as long as the two sides trust each other and enhance consultations. 

 Both sides agreed that China and Mongolia are economically complementary and have the potential and conditions for further expanding economic and trade cooperation. 

 They also agreed to continue to explore ways for increasing bilateral economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 

 Qian briefed Altangerel on the decision made by the China Red Cross Society to provide 20,000 US dollars in relief aid to its Mongolian counterpart, to help Mongolia's snowstorm victims. 

 Altangerel thanked Qian for this. 

 After the talks, Qian and Altangerel signed an agreement between the two governments on the placement of the Mongolian honorary consulate in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China. 

 Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Mongolian Ambassador to China Dagva Tsakhilgaan were present during the talks. 

 This evening, Qian hosted a dinner in honor of Altangerel and his party. Altangerel arrived here earlier today on an official visit to China as Qian's guest.
