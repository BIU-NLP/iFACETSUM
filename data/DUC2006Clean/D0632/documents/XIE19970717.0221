ULAN BATOR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is satisfied with its relations and cooperation with Japan, President Nachagyn Bagabandy told a Japanese parliamentary delegation today. 

 Developing Mongolian-Japanese relations is of primary importance, as Japan has supported Mongolia's reform and provided it with economic and technical assistance, Bagabandy said. 

 In addition, Japan has for years hosted international conferences of Mongolia's donators, and all these have contributed to stablizing the country's economy, he said. 

 Mongolia has received 1.484 billion U.S. dollars in aid and loan since 1991, with one third of it coming from Japan. 

 Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan and Chairman of the Great Hural (parliament) Radnasumberlyn Gonchigdorzh also met separately with the Japanese delegation during its four-day visit. 

 The delegation, headed by House of Representative Deputy Speaker Kozo Watanabe, arrived in Mongolia on Monday.
