ULAN BATOR, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy said that his country needs help from Germany to develop relations with the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 

 Bagabandy made the remarks while meeting with his German counterpart Roman Herzog, who concluded a four-day visit Tuesday. 

 Support and economic assistance from Germany is very important to Mongolia, Bagabandy told reporters after the meeting. 

 Herzog said that Germany, which supports Mongolia in developing market economy, will promote relations with this Asian country. 

 On Monday, the two countries signed six documents, including an agreement on 1998-1999 financial cooperation under which Germany will provide 25 million marks in aid. 

 Bilateral trade has developed rapidly in recent years, reaching 120 million marks (about 70 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 or 6.2 times more than in 1993.
