ULAN BATOR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia and Demark will further develop economic and trade cooperation, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen said here today. 

 Petersen left here today for China after a four-day visit. 

 The two countries will cooperate in the fields of energy, communications, environment protection, agriculture and livestock husbandry, said Petersen when he met with Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat during the visit. 

 The Danish foreign minister told Mongolian Prime Minister Mensaihani Enhsaihan that his country would urge the European Union and some other world organizations to give more aid to Mongolia. 

 Demark, which established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in August 1968, began to play an active role in helping this Asian country in 1991. It has decided to provide a grant of 27 million U.S. dollars to Mongolia between 1991-1997. 

 In addition, Demark has also offered some 2.8 million dollars of aid to Mongolia through the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organization for the implementation of the Education Program for Women in Gobi Desert.
