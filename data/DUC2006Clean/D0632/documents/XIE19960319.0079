ULAN BATOR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide free technical aid worth 400,000 U.S. dollars to Mongolia to help improve the living conditions of the country's poor. 

 An ADB representative, after signing the agreement here with Mongolian officials, told reporters poverty is one of the issues obstructing economic restructuring in Mongolia and the bank hopes the assistance will help solve the problem. 

 Montsame News Agency today said the assistance will go to the Mongolian Women's Foundation for Helping the Poor. 

 Earlier this month, the United Nations Development Program granted 800,000 U.S. dollars to the foundation. 

 A poverty alleviation program set up by the Mongolian government in 1995 will cost the country 83.6 million U.S. dollars. But half the cost is expected to come from international organizations and foreign nations.
