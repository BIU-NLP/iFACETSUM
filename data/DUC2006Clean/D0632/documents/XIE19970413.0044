ULAN BATOR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Chairman Qiao Shi said today that China attaches great importance to developing friendly and good-neighborly relations with Mongolia. 

 China sees Mongolia as an important neighbor, Qiao noted, saying that it will always respect Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as its people's own choice for their social system and road of development. 

 The Sino-Mongolian cooperation in various fields has expanded since the normalization of the two countries' relations in 1989, Qiao said while meeting Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of Mongolia's State Great Hural, the country's top legislature. 

 China is willing to push forward, together with Mongolia, long-term and stable friendly and good-neighborly relations and cooperation on the basis of the five principles of the peaceful co-existence and the China-Mongolia Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation, he said. 

 The top Chinese legislator pointed out that China is especially willing to further its economic and trade ties with Mongolia. 

 On his part, Gonchigdorj thanked the Chinese government and people for their support and assistance during Mongolia's transition from a planning economy to a market-oriented one. 

 One important part of Mongolia's foreign policy, he said, is to strength friendly relations and cooperation with China, which is not only in the interests of the two countries, but also favorable for peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region. 

 Mongolia is willing to establish friendly relations and cooperation with China geared towards the 21st century, he added. 

 Mongolia is the last stop of Qiao's European and Asian tour, which has already taken him to France, Norway and Italy. It is also the first visit to Mongolia by a Chinese NPC chairman.
